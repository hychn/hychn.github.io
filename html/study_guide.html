<h1>Study guide</h1>

<ul>
<li>When a student is exasperatingly slow, the trouble is almost always the same
<ul>
<li>he has no desire at all to solve the problem,</li>
<li>even no desire to understand it properly
<ul>
<li>a lack of concentration, wait clumsily for some idea to come and connot do anythign that would accelerate it's coming</li>
<li>rush into calculations or constructions without any plan or general idea</li>
</ul></li>
<li>so stir up his curiosity, give him some desire to solve the problem</li>
<li>allow some time to the student to make his mind, to settle down to his task</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Teaching to solve problems is education of the will</p>

<ul>
<li>Solving problems which are not too easy for him, the student learns to 
<ul>
<li>persevere through unsuccess,</li>
<li>to appreciate small advances,</li>
<li>to wait for the essential idea</li>
<li>to concentrate with all his might when it appears</li>
<li>familiarize with the varying emotions of the struggle for the solution</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>anchor points are an extremely strong tool, to anchor your thoughts and thought directions</p>

<ul>
<li>They can be questions, key properties, objectives</li>
<li>Without anchor points, your mind can wander and you can feel naseous</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Problem solving is a loop process</p>

<ul>
<li>Define problem (impact what do we need to know, what are the key elements of problem? what are the issues?</li>
<li>Where should we spend our time? Analysis what are we trying to prove/disprove?</li>
<li>So what, what implications does our findings have?</li>
<li>potential solution: what should we do?</li>
<li>next iteration</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>4 phases of solution</p>

<ul>
<li>understanding of problem
<ul>
<li>incomplete understanding, lack of concentration</li>
</ul></li>
<li>devise a plan
<ul>
<li>rush into calclation and construction without any plan or general idea</li>
<li>wait clumsily for some idea to come and cannot do anythign that would accelerate its coming</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Carrying out the plan 
<ul>
<li>carelessness, lack of patience checking each steap</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Check the result
<ul>
<li>failure to check result</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Create questions whose answer will allow you to retrace the development of the ideas</li>
<li>Ask questions as you go and answer them</li>
<li><p>Active Learning Mapping Exercise</p>

<ul>
<li>Identify each component in the definition
<ul>
<li>See what the extremes of this component along various dimensions (length, other characteristic)</li>
<li>Can/How other properties component affect/interact with the definition? (It almost certainly will)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Ask questions about new description</li>
<li>What essential informations is being captured from the definition? Why this definition?</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>short list of recurring, important, fundamental ideas</p></li>
<li>less is more</li>
<li>Time, time to grow</li>
</ul>

<h1>Exercises</h1>

<ul>
<li>discourse with author
<ul>
<li>where you can gain new insights</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h1>Goal</h1>

<ul>
<li>be able to reason and solve questions in the field effectively
<ul>
<li>even though they may take some time, ultimately be able to draw conclusions</li>
</ul></li>
<li>it is not: a list of problems and theorems you have originally found or proven</li>
</ul>

<h1>Mood</h1>

<ul>
<li>Be happy and thankful</li>
<li>Give glory to God</li>
<li>Cautious optimism</li>
<li>If uncomfortable/head hurts, reorganize and consider better way</li>
<li>Rest, sleep, health, relaxed-alert</li>
<li>Be careful of your sources of motivation; internal/external</li>
<li>Before, I used to feel proud of myself of my little accomplishments to help me feel better and safer
<ul>
<li>But now... I can't. I know how little these things mean </li>
<li>And with more I learn, the more I realize how little I know</li>
<li>I will not boast of works</li>
<li>I will just be happy for the sake of being happy</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h1>Heuristic</h1>

<ul>
<li>Anchor points</li>
<li>Consider the most basic facts and lay them out</li>
<li>When really stuck, investigate the objects &amp; their properties that are involved</li>
<li>Consider the opposite, other-direction</li>
<li>Focus on the big picture</li>
<li>Mapping
<ul>
<li>what is the mindset that will naturally give these mappings?
<ul>
<li>In what way can, A interact with B? A&amp;B interact with C? ... for all A,B,C in knowledge</li>
</ul></li>
<li>When learning set of new objects X
<ul>
<li>XRX->B</li>
<li>+:XxX -> X</li>
<li>special objects in X with respect to *</li>
<li>f(X) ~ g(X)</li>
<li>= &lt;</li>
<li>How does it relate to old definitions/relations?</li>
<li>Consider the variations in the defintion?</li>
<li>intra and inter relationship of definition</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h1>Notes</h1>

<ul>
<li>sectioned, modular pairings of (details, outline)
<ul>
<li>details: notes, proofs, insights</li>
<li>outline: concise organization of ideas
<ul>
<li>similar to cs program</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Want them to be useful, refreshing myself on the topic, dont want to forget</li>
</ul>

<h1>Learning by managing stress and repetition</h1>

<ul>
<li>short-term stress enhances the connections your brain makes, require fewer repetitions
<ul>
<li>coffee, cold water, exercise</li>
</ul></li>
<li>repetition types
<ul>
<li>writing notes</li>
<li>explaining from scratch</li>
<li>orating, teaching</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
