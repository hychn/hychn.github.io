<li>How does the distinction of proper class and set avoid the paradox?</li>
<li>We are essentially saying, M does not belong in this discussion because it cannot be a member of a set

<li>M cannot be X</li>
</ul></li>
<li>What does that mean for \(M \in M\) or \(M \not\in M\)?

<h1>How to organize findings at high level and the work that went in?</h1>

<ul>
<li>Organize the findings at high level,</li>
<li>Organize the work patterns at a high level</li>
<li>And forget it, dont hold on to too much</li>
</ul>

<h1>Organization of ideas, heuristic</h1>

<ul>
<li>HEUR What am I looking at, at a very abstract level?</li>
<li>HEUR Is there a clear way to define all the combinations of things? How big should the combinations be?</li>
<li>HEUR Negation Consider the negation. a and !a</li>
<li>HEUR Relations of a,b: a=b, a~b </li>
<li>NOTE HEALTH&amp;MENTAL I am pretty sure my need to reboot my brain is due to chemical imbalance/reinforced by bad reward loop. Which is why I think the advice of not taking oneself seriously is super important.
<ul>
<li>What to do when you find yourself in a bad state? </li>
<li>Create new state. Formed by the same mechanism that you arrived to the bad state.</li>
<li>Identify bad feedback loops and stop em in the future.
<ul>
<li>Result based reward vs Effort/instrinsic value based reward</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>HEUR Examples</li>
<li>HEUR Questions
<ul>
<li>What do questions and examples do?
<ul>
<li>Examples are a bit clear. It is an estimation or a phenomenum. It is a specific thing.
<ul>
<li>Focuses attention on specific things.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Questions It asks for an answer. directs attention. Can be more open ended.
<ul>
<li>Advance the current attention towards another goal.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>HEUR Consider alternate forms of the same object
<ul>
<li>Question-noun, question,ask-verb, questionable-adj</li>
</ul></li>
<li>HEUR Negation Example, Negation Question</li>
<li>HEUR What is the most abstract whay to look at</li>
<li><p>HEUR What do you want? Specific examples. A model which satistfies the different examples.</p></li>
<li><p>What I as primarly dealing with was imagination/intuition/examining the properties and consequences</p>

<ul>
<li>Examine the pros/cons</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>HEUR Goal oriented thinking. </p>

<ul>
<li>Gives you adrenaline/drive proximity to your goal</li>
<li>Cannot overdo it. Needs rest.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>DEF 2 statements are equal. f1(x,y,z) f2(a,b,c)</p>

<ul>
<li>f1=f2 := f1(x,y,z,a,b,c) = f2(x,y,z,a,b,c)
<ul>
<li>In this approach you added more variables</li>
</ul></li>
<li>f1=f2 := f1(x,y,z) &lt;-> f2(a,b,c)
<ul>
<li>if f1 true then f2 true</li>
<li>if f2 true then f1 true</li>
<li>Since !(f1 true) is (f1 false), and using the contrapositives, A&lt;->B !A&lt;->!B</li>
<li>Does this definition give us the desired properties of equality?</li>
<li>A=A, A=B->B=A, A=B&amp;B=C->A=C</li>

<li>??? Woah, why is &amp;,| similar
A B A&amp;B A|B
T T  T   T
T F  F   T
F T  F   T
F F  F   F</li>
<li>Its beautiful, the way it just works...</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Substitution A=B->A@C=B@C</p></li>
<li><p>F(A) and !A->!F(A). Then A</p>

<ul>
<li>T=A|!A</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>HEUR</strong> Statement/Argument simple and general as possible</p></li>
<li><p>DEF Implication Linking. A, as a consequence we get B</p>

<ul>
<li>A->B</li>
<li>??? How do we formally formulate this?
<ul>
<li>Suppose A, and you find B to be true. Then you can write A->B</li>
<li>What do you mean by find? 
<ul>
<li>(Go back to the LOGIC TABLE representation) 
<ul>
<li>Is there a simpler representation instead of a full table? </li>
<li>(describes some general property of how the table is formed)
<ul>
<li>Table has rows, we are interested in values of 1 row, given certain values</li>
<li>values on each cell can be T or F</li>
<li>writing A->B could be describing the behavior of the whole table... 
<ul>
<li>namely that when A is T, B is T over all the rows in the table</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>(Another functional/mapping representation)
<ul>
<li>Do we really need this 'row' can we just work with the variables?</li>
<li>Well, fundamentally the different variables form a table...?</li>
<li>well defined: each domain has single output -> the inverse is well defined
<ul>
<li>is there a better word? unique</li>
<li>In your table analogy, the rows have this property
<ul>
<li>Good, we isolated this critical property</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>SHOW A&amp;(B|C) = X</p>

<ul>
<li>->
<ul>
<li>APPROACH S1 -> A,B -> S2</li>
<li>A&amp;(B|C) -> A,(B|C)</li>
<li>A=T, B=T&amp;B -> B=A&amp;B</li>
<li>B=A&amp;B, C=A&amp;C -> (B|C) = (A&amp;B)|(A&amp;C) = X</li>
</ul></li>
<li>&lt;- (NOTE My guess is that this direction is bit more complex)
<ul>
<li>(A&amp;B)|(A&amp;C)</li>
<li>Suppose !A. Then our statement becomes (F&amp;B)|(F&amp;C) = F|F =F, which cannot be.
<ul>
<li>??? Why cannot be and consequently A=T? (Explain this to me again, this is quite fundamental)</li>
<li>You must make a distinction on what stating A means, ??? Why is it done in this style? what are the consquences of doing it in this style?</li>
<li>F(A). Suppose !A -> !F(A) ??? so the question is what is the gap that takes us </li>
<li>contrapositive gives F(A)->A. (Dang really? this -> is really powerful) (Descriptor of LOGIC TABLE?)</li>
<li>NOTE: there is an alternate argument interpreting F as a mapping. well-defined properties as well
<ul>
<li>??? Does it mean these two ideas are related?</li>
<li>Why ofcourse. The well-defined is what we need to form A->B=!B->!A</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>This means A=T. Then our statement becomes (T&amp;B)|(T&amp;C) = B|C</li>
<li>So we have A,B|C = A&amp;(B|C)</li>
</ul></li>

<ul>
<li>Wouldn't you like to understand the motivating thoughts behind Groendick?</li>
<li>Or what he meant by a house and tools and framework?</li>
<li>I can only really experience these things when I am able-minded huh...
<ul>
<li>It's more of an experience than a achievement...</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>HEUR It might be worthwile to write some key motivating examples to guide the thought process</p></li>
<li>OH, don't i have... the lin alg stuff or alg stuff on a paper somewhere...</li>

<h1>Functions</h1>

<ul>
<li>class A,B domain and range</li>
<li>assignment from domain to range</li>
<li><p>f:A->B a->f(a)</p></li>
<li><p>These representations are binary in nature</p></li>
<li><p>AA, a->a</p></li>

<li><p>HEUR I feel overwhelmed when so many new ideas come and I cannot think of them carefully</p>

<ul>
<li>It's a familiar feeling, when there is too much to handle</li>
<li>I just end up rushing through the important stuff</li>
<li>Often times I have given up... or just had forgetten or repressed. Why does this happen?</li>
<li>How can I over come?</li>
<li>Its ok to be wrong or to miss things. 
<ul>
<li>Try again and again until satistfactory</li>
<li>Try in an earnest manner, your heart must be in it.</li>
<li>Try whole-heartedly, towards a good direction</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Be comfortable with an incomplete understanding.
<ul>
<li>As a student, you'll run into many abstract definitions: topological spaces, metric spaces, manifolds, the various structures of abstract algebra, and so on. </li>
<li>In math, a definition is what it is, no more and no less. While it's very good to develop an intuition about these various objects, there's a danger of looking for some deeper meaning that just isnt there.</li>
<li>John von Neumann once said, In mathematics you don't understand things. You just get used to them.</li>
<li>I don't advise taking this quote too literally, but I think it reinforces the point of not worrying about understanding everything right away.</li>
