<p>Dear Professor Guo,</p>

<p>I have read the paper on Holographic-Type Communication (HTC). It is an exciting and challenging field.
The high-bandwith and low-lantecy requirements of HTC applications are areas where deep learning can make a significant and meaningful impact.
Here are several thoughts I had.
1. The representation and encoding of point cloud data using deep learning is quite relevant. Many early foundation neural networks (such as U-Net, Transformers, deeplabv3) were sucessful using the encoder-decoder architecture. I think the problem  of encoding and decoding point cloud data will extend well to machine learning.
2. Encoding and decoding messages using semantic communication to minimize semantic errors is an interesting application. The image and text joint coding is very intersting and seems promising.
3. I am not familar with network planning and control. This research sound interesting and is something I am willing to learn. What are your thoughts on this topic?
4. Applying user motion prediction to reduce latency and mitigating errors caused by incorrect prediction, packet loss, or noise are good problems that deep learning can definite address.
5. Alot of the papers mentioned seem to use graph neural networks (GNN). I am familiar with the theory of these networks. It would be nice to practice applying GNNs to reproduce the results of some of the papers.</p>
