<li>SIMPLE AND TO THE POINT</li>
</ul>

<h1>Purpose ===========================================================================================================</h1>

<ul>
<li><p>General questions and simple, natural ideas that form the answer; these things fascinate and bring me great joy.</p>

<ul>
<li>Here are two examples I encountered, while working in the industry for the past three years.</li>
<li>First, while classifying and segmenting satellite images, I explored the simple ideas: Image processing kernels that modifies images(blur,outline,dialate), nonlinear-activation functions, gradient descent to adjust parameters of kernels.
<ul>
<li>It was very satistfying seeing such simple ideas work together to classify large areas of terrain accurately and much faster than human annotation.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Second, when handling complex input data with instrinsic structure, I learned to encode the input data to a smaller latent space. 
<ul>
<li>Then, the input representation was transformed with respect to the structure. </li>
<li>When working with 3D robotic-arm in images or 3D structure in 1D protein sequences, these ideas allowed the AI to handle the complex input much more efficiently and observe the 3D structure's properties.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>How do you optimize a parameter that has no derivative? Does a local optimum exist at all?</p>

<ul>
<li>This is a key question that I encountered many times, while finding: 
<ul>
<li>an optimal model architecture for predicting satellite images, loss function for protein structure prediction, different estimations of cost-to-go function in reinforcement learning.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Searching and estimation by sampling are good, natural ideas that could answer this question.</li>
<li>However, I was not satisfied with the simple but impractical approach, exhaustive sampling. It took so long!</li>
<li>With more specific questions, I wish to explore this key question in more details:
<ul>
<li>Does an optimal solution exist? What are it's characteristics?</li>
<li>What different types of sampling and estimation can we form? What are the consequence of using each? Are some better than others?</li>
<li>Can we measure the quality of the estimation?</li>
<li>What are the meaningful conditions/situations, where stronger conclusions can emerge?</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<li>Books</li>
</ul>

<h1>Why you are qualified (1-3) paragraphs ==============================================================================</h1>

<ul>
<li><em>Primarily discuss the obstacles youve conquered, those which prove youre ready to succeed in this great new journey.</em></li>
<li>I am know that the program will be a challenging and require me to push beyond my comfort zone.</li>
<li><p>My experiences of overcoming difficulties in academics and industry makes me well-prepared for this.</p></li>
<li><p>Applied Mathematics and Computer Science master's degree gives me a strong background for applying logical and theoretical concepts.</p>

<ul>
<li>Courses such as Linear Algebra, Algebra, Analysis, Operations Research provide a solid background to understand ideas at a fundamental level.</li>
<li>In master's thesis, analyzing protein structure using CNNs and persistant homology, gave me valuable interdisciplinary insight on how math and CS can compliment each other.</li>
<li>Futhermore, I found myself enjoying the many hours thinking, meditating, and exploring theoretical concepts and questions.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Working in the industry gave me valuable experience overcoming difficult problems and producing consistant results.</p>

<ul>
<li>Here are three examples.</li>
<li>First, working on segmentation of satellite images gave me opportunity to read, implement from scratch, and benchmarked papers such as U-Net and Deep Aggregate Net.
<ul>
<li>The prototype and analysis data was used to win a major government contract for our company.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Second, while developing a semiconductor-robot monitoring prototype for SK hynix, I combined Novel View Synthesis CNN algorithm with pose estimation to track and pose the robot arm.
<ul>
<li>The prototype was used to automatically extract to extract key details from a complex semiconductor monitoring video: the movement of the robotic arm, the various nozzles attached to the arm, when the nozzle was spraying a solution or not</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Finally, working protein structure prediction at our startup company </p>

<ul>
<li>LSTM, positional embedding</li>
<li>angle, distance loss</li>
<li>much more stable, consistant, and quickly converging</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>In all of these projects Break through and difficult problems</p>

<ul>
<li>Cautious Optimism assumption that a nice explanation exists</li>
<li>Drown out the distractions and focus on key objectives</li>
<li>Pace myself and work at a steady, consistant rate</li>
</ul></li>
