<li><p>SIMPLE AND TO THE POINT</p></li>
<li><p>Simple, natural ideas that form the answers to difficult, general questions; these are the things that fascinate and bring me great joy.</p></li>
<li>Here are some examples</li>
<li>During my time image processing projects
<ul>
<li>I encountered... with Image processing kernels that can blur, outline, and dialate an image.</li>
<li>Minimizing the loss with respect to these kernels.</li>
<li>Augment kernels to focus on boundary regions loss</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Breaking down complex input (like an image of an object in various conformations/perspective or protein sequence) into a latent space and applying some rules in this space
<ul>
<li>Encoding into latent space and performing rotations in image generation</li>
<li>Or building protins out of the latent space</li>
</ul></li>
<li>How to minimize lost with respect to non-differentiable function
<ul>
<li>Hyper parameter optimization</li>
<li>Unsatisfying answer: have to try every combination many times</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h1>PURPOSE</h1>

<ul>
<li>Provoking questions and simple, natural ideas that form the answers; these are the things that fascinate and bring me great joy.</li>
<li>Some of the ideas that I am fond of.
<ul>
<li>Minimizing loss w.r.t to convolution kernels (which are typically used for bluring, outline in image processing) gave way to Convolution Neural Networks, an extremly important type of network.</li>
<li>Encoding inputs into a latent space representation to analyze their distributions and combine them to create new output.</li>
<li>Invertible neural networks and finding inputs that can create the similar ouputs.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Some of questions that were difficult and are unanswered. (why?, do these tie into a common theme?)
<ul>
<li>How to optimize parameters that are not differentiable? (hyper parameter optimization (landcover, protein struct losses combined learning rate). Reinforcement Learning)
<ul>
<li>MCST model, what was I doing? adjustments of rollout (prediction of v, rollout using v)
<ul>
<li>iterated rollout</li>
</ul></li>
<li>(Efficiently train) Sample Efficiency of reinforcement Learning/ML</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Estimation of function and achieving guarantees optimal cost bound </li>
<li>Auxillary cost and relationship to true cost?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>GOAL
<ul>
<li>Study the questions and related ideas. (how?)</li>
<li>Explore and combine simple, natural ideas to answer these questions in theory and practice.</li>
<li>Discovery new questions and be able to answer them with training</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<hr />

<pre><code>* I hope to explore these questions, break them down into simpler questions, restrict them under meaningful conditions.
* I hope to study the ideas and their inter-relationship. related to similar questions.
</code></pre>

<hr />

<pre><code>* Explore, Reframe, break down/restrict these questions, understand, discovery ideas and the relationships between them.
* And suggest simple, natural ideas that can answer these questions in practice.
* Theory-Application
