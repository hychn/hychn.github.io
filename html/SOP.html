<li>SIMPLE AND TO THE POINT</li>
</ul>

<h1>Purpose</h1>

<ul>
<li>General questions and simple, natural ideas that form the answer; these things fascinate and bring me great joy.</li>
<li>Here are two examples I encountered, while working in the industry for the past three years.</li>
<li>First, while classifying and segmenting satellite images for a government project, I explored and combined the following simple ideas: Image kernels that can blur, outline, and dialate an image, nonlinear-activation functions, gradient descent to adjust parameters of kernels.</li>
<li>It was very satistfying seeing such simple ideas work together to classify large areas of terrain accurately and much faster than human annotation.</li>
<li>Second, when working complex input data with instrinsic structure, I learned to encode the input data to a smaller latent space. Then, the input representation was transformed with respect to the structure. When working with 3D robotic-arm pose in images or 3d structure in 1D protein sequences, these ideas allowed the AI to handle the complex input much more efficiently.</li>
</ul>

<p>such as 3d structure of protein input sequence and 3d orientation of objects in 2d images.
;I explored the idea of latent space
with input/output data that has instrinsic </p>

<ul>
<li>Exhibit complex behaviors such as segment satellite images and identify key points of robotic arm pose from varying perspectives.</li>
<li>When I was working with input that required more structure,</li>
<li>Breaking down complex input (like an image of an object in various conformations/perspective or protein sequence) into a latent space and applying some rules in this space
<ul>
<li>Encoding into latent space and performing rotations in image generation</li>
<li>Or building protins out of the latent space</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>However, while studying there where/was a question which I found difficult to answer</p>

<ul>
<li>How to minimize lost with respect to non-differentiable function
<ul>
<li>Hyper parameter optimization</li>
<li>Unsatisfying answer: have to try every combination many times</li>
<li>Wish to formulate a more structured answer

<h1>PURPOSE</h1>

<ul>
<li>Provoking questions and simple, natural ideas that form the answers; these are the things that fascinate and bring me great joy.</li>
<li>Some of the ideas that I am fond of.
<ul>
<li>Minimizing loss w.r.t to convolution kernels (which are typically used for bluring, outline in image processing) gave way to Convolution Neural Networks, an extremly important type of network.</li>
<li>Encoding inputs into a latent space representation to analyze their distributions and combine them to create new output.</li>
<li>Invertible neural networks and finding inputs that can create the similar ouputs.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Some of questions that were difficult and are unanswered. (why?, do these tie into a common theme?)
<ul>
<li>How to optimize parameters that are not differentiable? (hyper parameter optimization (landcover, protein struct losses combined learning rate). Reinforcement Learning)
<ul>
<li>MCST model, what was I doing? adjustments of rollout (prediction of v, rollout using v)
<ul>
<li>iterated rollout</li>
</ul></li>
<li>(Efficiently train) Sample Efficiency of reinforcement Learning/ML</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Estimation of function and achieving guarantees optimal cost bound </li>
<li>Auxillary cost and relationship to true cost?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>GOAL
<ul>
<li>Study the questions and related ideas. (how?)</li>
<li>Explore and combine simple, natural ideas to answer these questions in theory and practice.</li>
<li>Discovery new questions and be able to answer them with training</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
