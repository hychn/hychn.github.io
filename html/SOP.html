<li>SIMPLE AND TO THE POINT</li>
</ul>

<h1>PURPOSE</h1>

<ul>
<li>Provoking questions and simple, natural ideas that form the answers; these are the things that fascinate and bring me great joy.</li>
<li>Some of the ideas that I am fond of.
<ul>
<li>Minimizing loss w.r.t to convolution kernels (which are typically used for bluring, outline in image processing) gave way to Convolution Neural Networks, an extremly important type of network.</li>
<li>Encoding inputs into a latent space representation to analyze their distributions and combine them to create new output.</li>
<li>Invertible neural networks and finding inputs that can create the similar ouputs.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Some of questions that were difficult and are unanswered. (why?, do these tie into a common theme?)
<ul>
<li>(optimizing without gradient descent) hyper parameter optimization, RL</li>
<li>(Efficiently train) Sample Efficiency of reinforcement Learning/ML
<ul>
<li>MCST model, what was I doing? adjustments of rollout (prediction of v, rollout using v)
<ul>
<li>iterated rollout</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Estimation of function and achieving guarantees optimal cost bound </li>
<li>Auxillary cost and relationship to true cost?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>GOAL
<ul>
<li>Study the questions and related ideas. (how?)</li>
<li>Explore and combine simple, natural ideas to answer these questions in theory and practice.</li>
<li>Discovery new questions and be able to answer them with training</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>I hope to explore these questions, break them down into simpler questions, restrict them under meaningful conditions.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>I hope to study the ideas and their inter-relationship. related to similar questions.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
