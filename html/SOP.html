<li>SIMPLE AND TO THE POINT</li>
</ul>

<h1>Purpose ===========================================================================================================</h1>

<ul>
<li><p>General questions and simple, natural ideas that form the answer; these things fascinate and bring me great joy.</p>

<ul>
<li>Here are two examples I encountered, while working in the industry for the past three years.</li>
<li>First, while classifying and segmenting satellite images for a government project, I explored and combined the following simple ideas: Image kernels that can blur, outline, and dialate an image, nonlinear-activation functions, gradient descent to adjust parameters of kernels.
<ul>
<li>It was very satistfying seeing such simple ideas work together to classify large areas of terrain accurately and much faster than human annotation.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Second, when handling complex input data with instrinsic structure, I learned to encode the input data to a smaller latent space. 
*Then, the input representation was transformed with respect to the structure. 
<ul>
<li>When working with 3D robotic-arm pose in images or 3d structure in 1D protein sequences, these ideas allowed the AI to handle the complex input much more efficiently.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>How do you optimize a parameter that has no derivative? Does a local optimum exist at all?</p>

<ul>
<li>This is a key question that I encountered many times, while finding: 
<ul>
<li>an optimal model architecture for predicting satellite images, loss function for protein structure prediction, different estimations of cost-to-go function in reinforcement learning.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Searching and estimation by sampling are good, natural ideas that could answer this question.</li>
<li>However, I was not satisfied with the simple but impractical approach, exhaustive sampling.</li>
<li>With more specific questions, I wish to explore this key question in more details:
<ul>
<li>Does an optimal solution exist? What are it's characteristics?</li>
<li>What different types of sampling and estimation can we form? What are the consequence of using each?</li>
<li>Can we measure the quality of the estimation?</li>
<li>What interesting situations and conditions are there, where stronger conclusions can follow?</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h1>PURPOSE</h1>

<ul>
<li>Provoking questions and simple, natural ideas that form the answers; these are the things that fascinate and bring me great joy.</li>
<li>Some of the ideas that I am fond of.
<ul>
<li>Minimizing loss w.r.t to convolution kernels (which are typically used for bluring, outline in image processing) gave way to Convolution Neural Networks, an extremly important type of network.</li>
<li>Encoding inputs into a latent space representation to analyze their distributions and combine them to create new output.</li>
<li>Invertible neural networks and finding inputs that can create the similar ouputs.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Some of questions that were difficult and are unanswered. (why?, do these tie into a common theme?)
<ul>
<li>How to optimize parameters that are not differentiable? (hyper parameter optimization (landcover, protein struct losses combined learning rate). Reinforcement Learning)
<ul>
<li>MCST model, what was I doing? adjustments of rollout (prediction of v, rollout using v)
