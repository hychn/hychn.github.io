<h1>Passion</h1>

<ul>
<li>Strength is in our level of "passion" and really, nothing more than that. If we have high passion and that passion remains high, everything will eventually unfold in the direction we have in mind.</li>
<li>I had a passion for developing products that reproduce music that began in high school and became stronger in college and today I'm 73 and a sr tech contributor at Apple…still doing what I love.</li>
<li>I'd suggest also having a passion for Goodness* which will keep you on a healthy patt as you move forward.</li>
<li>Transcendent love: a free gift of hoping for the virtuous betterment of the inner child-chooser within ourselves and others. It is unconditional with no expectations in return and frees us and others of our fears so we can gain confidence, understanding and skill without being angry or defensive.</li>
<li>Virtue: truthful, wise, logical, prudent, fearless, trustworthy, praiseworthy, self-restraint, lacking corruption, forgiving, organized, clean, caring, principled, wisely generous, humble, courageous.</li>
<li>Wisdom: allows us to avoid traps and guides us to success using accumulated insights into what works and what doesn't work in life and relationships.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Training</h1>

<p>Three words: train your brain. When you develop a strategy for how to do this, the entire learning process becomes less of a chore and more of an exploration of knowledge. And the result? You will feel much more empowered because you’ll be able to retain what you learn so that you can recall it successfully later when you need it.</p>

<p>These 5 tips can help you get started.</p>

<h1>Tip #1. Let your brain map out the learning process.</h1>

<p>Why is this important?</p>

<p>This technique is called building a mental model: you imagine in detail how you expect things will go as you are learning something new. By telling yourself a story, you train your brain to anticipate next steps and expect a positive outcome.</p>

<p>How do you do it?</p>

<p>Start your day by visualizing your success with learning. Do this before you begin a study session, and set aside about 5–10 minutes for this activity. You can do it either before you get up in the morning, while you’re having breakfast, or right after breakfast as youre sitting with your eyes closed.
Be detailed in thinking about all the steps you will take. This can include covering the chapters and exercises planned for that day, to taking the time to review the material, to writing out an outline of important concepts.
Anticipate and identify challenges. This helps you prepare for problems so you dont end up getting surprised because you dont understand how something works or what it means. Then, come up with ways to resolve this: ask an expert, post a question to an online forum such as Quora, or designate a little extra time for review.
Imagine a successful end to your day. Maybe youre still on the path of mastering a skill or a class, but its still important to experience the entire process, not just the end result. Celebrating small wins every day will boost your motivation and help you feel more positive about moving ahead.</p>

<h1>Tip #2. Do the most important and most difficult stuff early.</h1>

<p>Why is this important?</p>

<p>You take full advantage of your circadian rhythm which dictates which activities youre more likely to do best at certain times of the day. Doing your hard work early in the day allows your brain to focus fully on the material in front of you with fewer distractions, less inputs from your environment, and with more energy that youve gained from a restful night.</p>

<p>How do you do it?</p>

<p>Maximize your brains peak performance. For most people (and try it to see if you fall into this category), this happens 2-4 hours after you wake up: if you get up at 7, the peak time is 9–11 a.m. This is when your analytical brain takes over and you can focus better on difficult problems.
Eliminate distractions. Try turning off your phone or at least the volume setting. Avoid responding to calls and text messages, and ignore other distractions such as emails, reading the news or whats in your social media feed. Youll notice a big difference in the way and the speed at which you can absorb new material when you are not distracted.</p>

<h1>Tip #3. Use a timer to make progress faster.</h1>

<p>Why is this important?</p>

<p>Theres no need to sit in your room all day or all night studying. Just because youre poring over a book for hours doesnt mean its real study. Instead, use a timer to maximize each learning session. This allows your brain to focus in a more targeted and effective way.</p>

<p>How should you do it effectively?</p>

<p>For reading and reviewing study material, set the timer to 30 or 60 minute increments. For really short but targeted sessions try the Pomodoro technique which consists of 25 minute blocks of time, followed by 5 minute breaks. When youre done with 4 Pomodoros, take a longer break: have lunch, go for a walk, or do something relaxing.
For exams preparation, you can use a timer to simulate the actual exam so you dont drag out your answers too long. Using the review questions from your textbook or handouts as a reference, write the questions down on a sheet of paper. Then, use the Pomodoro technique to give yourself only a short time to answer each question. Use each 25-minute block of time to cover several questions, and go down the list until youve covered them all.</p>

<h1>Tip #4. Use your notes as the ultimate study tool.</h1>

<p>Why is this important?</p>

<p>It puts you in the drivers seat of the learning process. It means that you shouldnt just sit and read passively; instead, you should write stuff down. This improves your brains cognitive skills, makes retention of information easier, and boosts memory.</p>

<p>How do you do it?</p>

<p>Note down whats relevant. This includes key concepts, ideas, and topics. Make sure you dont write down every single word, Instead, boost your critical thinking skills by identifying what is relevant to the topic. Check out the Cornell Method for an excellent strategy on how to note down the key stuff.
Use bulleted lists. This saves time, enables you to skim the material when you need it, helps you locate information faster, and makes the review process easier.
Use color. Get your notes organized with multi-colored pens, markers, or highlighters to emphasize the most important sections. Use specific colors to highlight top priority concepts, then pick other colors to identify second level priority items such as examples and additional information.
Make new information easy to find. When you find information you want to add to your notes later, draw an asterisk (*) next to the concept that you want to expand on, then add the new information in a footnote at bottom of the page.</p>

<h1>Tip #5. Teach what you learn.</h1>

<p>Why is this important?</p>

<p>Teaching is one of the most powerful memory techniques: you recall newly learned information by teaching it to someone else or simply retelling it to yourself out loud. This helps you review, recall, and retain what youve learned better than just silently looking over the material.</p>

<p>How do you do it?</p>

<p>First, get an audience: a close friend, study partner, family member, even your dog. If you feel awkward or shy about it, just pretend you have a couple of invisible students.
Next, take a large sheet of white paper and tape it to your bedroom wall at eye level. This will be your work surface.
Then, get to work: write an outline of the most important points in the chapter you just covered, then go over the concepts aloud one by one.
Make it dynamic: You can draw diagrams on the side and provide a few examples. Its also a good idea to summarize the key parts and highlight these sections with your thick marker or highlighter, which helps you recall details and reinforce what youve learned.</p>
