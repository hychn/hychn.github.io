<h1>Shortboard</h1>

<ul>
<li>He had his feet held up slightly out of the water and one ankle crossed over the other. He was flying
<ul>
<li>Since then I've been trying to keep my feet together and my toes pointed backwards. It has made a huge difference in my surfing! I can paddle out much quicker, and get going on a wave much quicker. Also, it shifts my weight forward so I can really feel exactly where my chest is pressed on the board. I can feel if I'm on the sweet spot or not.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Another tip to add is you want to be centered on the board. Not too far back and having the nose of your board up in the air and vise versa.
<ul>
<li>I try to keep the nose of the board just barley underwater while paddling and combining this with your discovery works well.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>I'd bet the real point of this trick is that it moves your paddling center of gravity to the right spot. Lots of people get this wrong when starting surfing and when moving to shortboard, usually way too far back.
<ul>
<li>I usually tell people to have their center of gravity centered at the bottom of their tits. Just above the solar plexus.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>An add on to keeping your feet out of the water is keeping your legs as straight as possible in order to keep your weight back. The goal is to be scooted up as close to the front of the board as possible, of you bend your knees your moving your center of gravity forward and therefore have to scoot back. Also, don't flex your calfs. Quickest way to cramp up out ther</li>

<li>Frog kick when coming out of standby position</li>
<li>Try to ride along side of wave</li>
<li>Paddle, bend elbow reach under board</li>
<li>Paddle slow at start then fast at end.
  * start with elbow high?</li>
<li>Flutter kick at very end</li>
</ul>

<h1>popup and catching</h1>

<ul>
<li>timing is crucial</li>
<li>keeping your speed on shortboard is diffcult. you must not stop paddle</li>
<li>You want to controll the speed, not to fast not too slow just right
<ul>
<li>strong strokes, gradulally lighter faster stroke</li>
</ul></li>
<li>at the point where your speed is just right and you have not fall down on the wave, popup</li>
<li>popup straight perp to the wave</li>
<li>chest arced at start and adjust to maintain balance to not fall down the wave
  * arc back gives less speed, down gives more</li>
</ul>
