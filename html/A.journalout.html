<h2>CHANGING MINDSETS: A WORKSHOP</h2>

<pre><code>  In my work, I see lots of young children like this—bright, seemingly resourceful children who are paralyzed by setbacks
</code></pre>

<h2>FORGING RESOLVE</h2>

<pre><code>  Purpose gives direction to one’s efforts, but it does not necessarily makelife easier. Goals can lead into all sorts of trouble, at which point one getstempted to give them up and find some less demanding script by whichto  order  one’s  actions.  The  price  one  pays  for  changing  goals  wheneveropposition threatens is that while one may achieve a more pleasant andcomfortable life, it is likely that it will end up empty and void of meaning.

<h2>THE AUTOTELIC SELF: A SUMMARY</h2>

<pre><code>  In this chapter we have seen it demonstrated repeatedly that outside forcesdo not determine whether adversity will be able to be turned into enjoy-ment. A person who is healthy, rich, strong, and powerful has no greaterodds of being in control of his consciousness than one who is sickly, poor, weak, and oppressed. The difference between someone whoenjoys life and someone who is overwhelmed by it is a product of a com-bination of such external factors and the way a person has come to interpretthem—that is, whether he sees challenges as threats or as opportunities foraction

<h2>Energy</h2>

<pre><code>  Human beings have also managed to utilize waste energy to serve theirgoals. The first major technological invention, that of fire, is a good example.In the beginning, fires started at random: volcanoes, lightning, and spon-taneous combustion ignited fuel here and there, and the energy of the de-composing timber was dispersed without purpose. As they learned to takecontrol over fire people used the dissipating energy to warm their caves,cook their food, and finally to smelt and forge objects made of metal. En-gines run by steam, electricity, gasoline, and nuclear fusion are also basedon the same principle: to take advantage of energy that otherwise wouldbe  lost,  or  opposed  to  our  goals.  Unless  men  learned  various  tricks  fortransforming  the  forces  of  disorder  into  something  they  could  use,  wewould not have survived as successfully as we have

<h2>Coping with Stress</h2>

<pre><code>  When a man knows he is to be hanged in a fortnight, it concentrates hismind  wonderfully,”  remarked  Samuel  Johnson,  in  a  saying  whose  truthapplies to the cases just presented. A major catastrophe that frustrates acentral goal of life will either destroy the self, forcing a person to use allhis  psychic  energy  to  erect  a  barrier  around  remaining  goals,  defendingthem against further onslaughts of fate; or it will provide a new, more clear,and more urgent goal: to overcome the challenges created by the defeat.
</code></pre>

<h2>Tragedies transformed</h2>

<pre><code>  Through these experiences I have come to see that the world is notworth much. The only thing that counts for me now, first and last, isGod. I am most concentrated when I pray with my prayer beads. ThenI am able to put my feelings to sleep, to calm myself and avoid becom-ing crazy. I believe that destiny rules life, and it makes no sense tostruggle  too  hard....  During  my  journey  I  have  seen  hunger,  war,death, and poverty. Now through prayer I have begun to hear myself,I have returned toward my center, I have achieved concentration andI have understood that the world has no value. Man was born to betested on this earth. Cars, television sets, clothes are secondary. Themain thing is that we were born to praise the Lord. Everyone has hisown  fate,  and  we  should  be  like  the  lion  in  the  proverb.  The  lion,when he runs after a pack of gazelles, can only catch them one at atime.  I  try  to  be  like  that,  and  not  like  Westerners  who  go  crazyworking even though they cannot eat more than their daily bread....If I am to live twenty more years, I will try to live enjoying each mo-ment, instead of killing myself to get more.... If I am to live like a freeman who does not depend on anyone, I can afford to go slowly; if Idon’t earn anything today, it does not matter. It means that this hap-pens to be my fate. Next day I may earn 100 million—or get a terminalillness. Like Jesus Christ said, What does it benefit to man if he gainsthe entire world, but loses himself? I have tried first to conquer myself;I don’t care if I lose the world

<h2>Conditions for flow</h2>

<pre><code>  To enjoy a mental activity, one must meet the same conditions that makephysical  activities  enjoyable.  There  must  be  skill  in  a  symbolic  domain;there have to be rules, a goal, and a way of obtaining feedback.118 / Flow
</code></pre>

<h2>THE PEOPLE OF FLOW</h2>

<pre><code>  Richard Logan proposes an answer based on the writings of many sur-vivors, including those of Viktor Frankl and Bruno Bettelheim, who havereflected on the sources of strength under extreme adversity. He concludesthat the most important trait of survivors is a “nonself-conscious individu-alism,” or a strongly directed purpose that is not self-seeking. People whohave that quality are bent on doing their best in all circumstances, yet theyare not concerned primarily with advancing their own interests. Becausethey are intrinsically motivated in their actions, they are not easily disturbedby external threats. With enough psychic energy free to observe and analyzetheir surroundings objectively, they have a better chance of discovering inthem new opportunities for action. If we were to consider one trait a keyelement of the autotelic personality, this might be it. Narcissistic individuals,who are mainly concerned with protecting their self, fall apart when the externalconditions turn threatening. The ensuing panic prevents them from doingwhat they must do; their attention turns inward in an effort to restore orderin consciousness, and not enough remains to negotiate outside reality.

<h2>FLOW ACTIVITIES</h2>

<pre><code>When  describing  optimal  experience  in  this  book,  we  have  given  as  ex-amples  such  activities  as  making  music,  rock  climbing,  dancing,  sailing,chess, and so forth. What makes these activities conducive to flow is thatthey were designed to make optimal experience easier to achieve
</code></pre>

<h2>Control</h2>

<pre><code>Here is how a dancer expresses this dimension of the flow experience:“A  strong  relaxation  and  calmness  comes  over  me.  I  have  no  worries  offailure. What a powerful and warm feeling it is! I want to expand, to hugthe world. I feel enormous power to effect something of grace and beauty.” And a chess player: ...I have a general feeling of well-being, and that I am in complete control of my world.”What these respondents are actually describing is the possibility, ratherthan the actuality, of control. The ballet dancer may fall, break her leg, andnever  make  the  perfect  turn,  and  the  chess  player  may  be  defeated  andnever become a champion. But at least in principle, in the world of flowperfection is attainable.This sense of control is also reported in enjoyable activities that involveserious risks, activities that to an outsider would seem to be much morepotentially dangerous than the affairs of normal life. People who practicehang gliding, spelunking, rock climbing, race-car driving, deep-sea diving,and  many  similar  sports  for  fun  are  purposefully  placing  themselves  insituations that lack the safety nets of civilized life. Yet all these individualsreport flow experiences in which a heightened sense of control plays animportant part

<h2>THE ELEMENTS OF ENJOYMENT</h2>

<pre><code>Without enjoyment life can be endured, and it can even be pleasant. Butit can be so only precariously, depending on luck and the cooperation ofthe external environment. To gain personal control over the quality of ex-perience, however, one needs to learn how to build enjoyment into whathappens day in, day out.
</code></pre>

<h2>Attention</h2>

<pre><code>differentiation and integration. Differentiation implies a movement toward uniqueness, toward separating oneself from others. Integration refers to its opposite: a union with other people, with ideas andentities beyond the self. A complex self is one that succeeds in combiningthese opposite tendencies

<h2>Stretching</h2>

<pre><code>  People in a growth mindset dont just seek challenge, they thrive on it. The bigger the challenge, the more they stretch. And nowhere can it be seen more clearly than in the world of sports. You can just watch people stretch and grow.Mia Hamm, the greatest female soccer star of her time, says it straight out. All my life Ive been playing up, meaning Ive challenged myself with players older, bigger, more skillful, more experienced—in short, better than me. First she played with her older brother. Then at ten, she joined the eleven-year-old boys team. Then she threw herself into the number one college team in the United States. Each day I attempted to play up to their level . . . and I was improving faster than I ever dreamed possible. Patricia Miranda was a chubby, unathletic high school kid who wanted to wrestle. After a bad beating on the mat, she was told, Youre a joke. First she cried, then she felt: That really set my resolve . . . I had to keep going and had to know if effort and focus and belief and training could somehow legitimize me as a wrestler. Where did she get this resolve? Miranda was raised in a life devoid of challenge. But when her mother died of an aneurysm at age forty, ten-year-old Miranda came up with a principle. When youre lying on your deathbed, one of the cool things to say is, ‘I really explored myself. This sense of urgency was instilled when my mom died. If you only go through life doing stuff thats easy, shame on you. So when wrestling presented a challenge, she was ready to take it on. Her effort paid off. At twenty-four, Miranda was having the last laugh. She won the spot for her weight group on the U.S. Olympic team and came home from Athens with a bronze medal. And what was next? Yale Law School. People urged her to stay where she was already on top, but Miranda felt it was more exciting to start at the bottom again and see what she could grow into this time
