<h1>Free notes</h1>

<h2>Stress and mental fatigue</h2>

<ul>
<li>There is no such thing as mental tireness</li>
<li>It is stress that causes this</li>
<li>Remove yourself from the forms of stress</li>
<li>Its bad, non-optimal for thinking</li>
</ul>

<h2>New style of notetaking 2</h2>

<ul>
<li>Kind of feels redundant, I want to separate it out better</li>
<li>I dont think I should repeat, maybe keep the oringal notes for 
<ul>
<li>Examples</li>
<li>Proof</li>
<li>Extended Discussion</li>
</ul></li>
<li>And keep the second one as just MAP and links of ideas</li>
<li>As you work from MAP, you may need to prune some stuff over</li>
</ul>

<h2>A new style of note taking</h2>

<ul>
<li>In general, keep the things as simple as possible </li>
<li>Adding a high level view of just definitions and connections</li>
</ul>

<h2>Stress</h2>

<ul>
<li>Breathe</li>
<li>Mental fatigue is caused by stress</li>
<li>Stay low, steely and calm</li>
<li>Don't be committed or invested or emotional</li>
<li>How can you? Faith in God</li>
<li>Thanks and trust</li>
<li>Just try and practice</li>
<li>Nerves of Steel
<ul>
<li>Ability to remain calm under pressure or difficult situations</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>Dont muck your way through thought. It is form</h2>

<h2>Math study</h2>

<ul>
<li>Should think of different ways the objects can interact</li>
<li>While studying ask questions on try to branch out in simple areas. what should come next?</li>
</ul>

<h2>You really need to push yourself to grow</h2>

<ul>
<li>with thinking</li>
<li>Who do you wish to become?
<ul>
<li>How can you grow sharper, simpler, persistent, </li>
<li>You need to train and rest</li>
</ul></li>
<li>programming</li>
</ul>

<h2>Exploratory Creative Drive</h2>

<ul>
<li>Valheim:</li>
<li>Progression. I had a clear idea of what I wanted to become</li>
<li>Knew Vaguely what I needed and it was right ahead of me</li>
<li>Motivated me really well</li>
<li>Kepth going and going and absoring all sorts of information</li>
<li>Was really simple: I had some idea of what I needed to do</li>
</ul>

<h2>Competitive Drive</h2>

<ul>
<li>Can only compete well for short about of time</li>
<li>Simple and Optimize</li>
</ul>

<h2>To be able to think clearly</h2>

<ul>
<li>You must be mindful of the basic elements involved</li>
<li>This is very important</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why do I feel rushed. And feel like I am just skipping over details...</h2>

<ul>
<li>I feel like the previous days, I have not been working as hard as I should have</li>
<li>And to compensate I am trying to work extra hard</li>
<li>But you know, as with lifting, such a thing is not possible to achieve without sacrificing quality</li>
<li>Keep the quality
<ul>
<li>And be consistent</li>
<li>Use the feeling to make sure you are more consistent in the future</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Can't peak, need to be more consistent with your efforts in the long run
<ul>
<li>As with lifting, heavy sets followed by volume, perfect the form</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>At a point when you feel like you are slowing down.</h2>

<ul>
<li>If you need to move ahead, feel free to do so</li>
<li>Like working through an exam </li>
<li>what is the catch, that the stuff ahead doesn't depend on the previous material</li>
<li>I have mastered all of the material
<ul>
<li>Think, work, and sweat through every combination of ideas</li>
<li>Of course it is not easy!</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>Need to make sure I am thinking through the thing I read</h2>

<ul>
<li>I can do this by closing the book and recalling it in my memory</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why did I get stuck in this area for some time?</h2>

<ul>
<li>I think it was fine, the progression of ideas to prove this</li>
<li>Just needed to not get lost in the details and keep track of the big steps</li>
<li>I did feel overwhelmed and tired after making too many jumps without properly writing down the different steps</li>
</ul>

<h2>Sometimes when I write too much, i get lost in the details.</h2>

<ul>
<li>And focus too much on the writing aspect rather than thinking</li>
<li>I believe writing has it's merit but it should be done at key points, not detailing the details</li>
<li>Try to work in your head as much as possible</li>
<li>Also sometimes the latex formatting gets in the way of clearly organizing. 
<ul>
<li>Do keep the clear notes and later reorganize</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>Stop being results driven</h2>

<ul>
<li>just because you make alot of progress or win, it is not a indicator of how well you are doing</li>
<li>because there are too many variables that determine whether you are doing well or not</li>
</ul>

<h2>Sometimes you want to play</h2>

<ul>
<li>I can tell you (math) is one of the purest form of play there is really</li>
<li>Theme like space, underwater?</li>
<li>Anyone can do this, really. Just be dedicated and focused and persistent</li>
<li>Devoted</li>
</ul>

<h2>If your head hurts, go back and review</h2>

<ul>
<li>Update the notes and clean it up while reviewing</li>
<li>To make the review a pleasant process, take good notes</li>
</ul>

<h2>Look carefully at each statement, example, problem</h2>

<ul>
<li>And consider the possibilities and variations in it's statement</li>
<li>For example \((0,1/n) and (0,\inf)\)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Need continued inspiration</h2>

<ul>
<li>Faith</li>
<li>Motivation</li>
</ul>

<h2>When introduced with new object \(X\)</h2>

<ul>
<li>\(X R X\)</li>
<li>\(X + X\)
<ul>
<li>Special objects in the operation?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>\(X R X \rightarrow X Q X\)</li>
<li>function?</li>
</ul>

<h2>Exercises</h2>

<ul>
<li>Before I looked at exercises as just something I needed to prove and be done with</li>
<li>Now I see them as perspectives, points of view</li>
<li>And after one is resolved, I think, what is the implication, consequences of this?
<ul>
<li>How does this shift the way I can think about the objects</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>Ok, so I learned some considerable amount of information</h2>

<ul>
<li>How can I make them so they become second nature?</li>
<li>I feel like I am working through to 'prove' them again from scratch</li>
<li>Need to summarize what I learned in a common/natural sense way</li>
</ul>

<h2>Relax. Dont be anxious, its no way to live life.</h2>

<ul>
<li>Enjoy the process</li>
<li>Inspect each step</li>
<li>Take your time and make sure it is spent meaningfully</li>
</ul>

<h2>Hints are dangerous</h2>

<ul>
<li>need a proper reason to arrive at the solution</li>
<li>I had assumed \(x_1  <  x_2  <  x_3 ...\) when it was \(\{ x_1, x_2, x_3 \}\), leading me towards a wrong solution</li>
<li>Consider the most basic facts and lay them out</li>
<li>Assumptions are fine as long as you know they are assumptions and are willing to forgo</li>
</ul>

<h2>Dont aim to learn everything, learn to think and work through, the process</h2>

<h2>Exercise</h2>

<ul>
<li>To come up with potential good question that investigate connections.
<ul>
<li>And the solve these questions</li>
</ul></li>
<li>To come up with good examples</li>
<li>What kind of thing can help with building something like this?
<ul>
<li>Like a list of definitions and their input and output and descriptions/interactions/behavior and theorems</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>Lets break down definition supremum</h2>

<ul>
<li>\(sup S\) is a upper bound of \(S\)</li>
<li>if u is upper bound of \(S\), then \(sup S \leq u\)</li>
<li>What are the inputs that define supremum? (S set)</li>
<li>What are the output of the definition? (real value)</li>
<li>Can anything other than input output influence or server some connection?</li>
</ul>

<h2>In terms of time, right now things are easy</h2>

<ul>
<li>But later on its more difficult you should still set some timeline to make sure you don't slip</li>
<li>And also you need practice for when it is difficult </li>
<li>It doesn't have to be perfect but some sembalance of mastery is ok</li>
</ul>

<h2>There is a distinct difference VS</h2>

<ul>
<li>working out a problem loosely in your mind or on scratch</li>
<li>And writing out the formal statement</li>
<li>Make sure you are good on both and not get to focused on one aspect</li>
</ul>

<h2>When you dont feel motivated... what should you do?</h2>

<ul>
<li>Why you feel this way.</li>
<li>How can you change the way you feel?</li>
<li>I want to have fun</li>
<li>Just stay bored, day dream</li>
</ul>

<h2>Your routine, will define you who become</h2>

<ul>
<li>Do you remember when you used to exercise in the beginning? At DePauw or at Mizzou?</li>
<li>You spent a similar amount of time at the gym
<ul>
<li>How are you different then and now?, its the routine, exercise I spend doing.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>What kinds of routine or exercise can you do?</h2>

<ul>
<li>Manipulating ideas in your mind</li>
<li>Metric: Time, Steps, No of Ideas, No of Connections, Memory/Mindfulness, Familiarity/Recall
<ul>
<li>Time per task, assess how many effort it took</li>
<li>Go through each new idea and see if you can slowly see the potential connection</li>
<li>Move through the ideas in your head</li>
<li>How can you effectively learn new ideas and become familar with them?</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>When you learn a new definition:</h2>

<ul>
<li>Deconstruct it. play with it</li>
<li>Try to form connections to other existing nodes of knowledge</li>
<li>I think this will help to solidify the definition into your memory and mind</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to objectively track your mental skill?</h2>

<ul>
<li>What indicators can you track?
<ul>
<li>Time</li>
<li>No of ideas, steps
<ul>
<li>No of interconnected ideas</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Familiarity (New vs Old)</li>
<li>Parallel comparison between lifting, weight, rep, sets, form, </li>
<li>A realization i had with lifting is that the combinations of lifts that you build up, the routine is eventually what will make your physique</li>
</ul></li>
<li>How can you improve these areas? Practice and continued challenge</li>
</ul>

<h2>There is a meaningful meaning why something is the case. carefully search for it</h2>

<h2>You have to be comfortable in your own skin to be able to think freely</h2>

<ul>
<li>To be able to relax and not be anxious</li>
<li>Breathe</li>
</ul>

<h2>Goal is how can I become a better navigator of ideas</h2>

<ul>
<li>Why is it important to have collaries and branch out?
<ul>
<li>To have more interesting perspectives and starting points</li>
</ul></li>
<li>When should you return to an idea?</li>
<li>Practice the technique of finding solution. It is easy to forget ideas but if you have technique you can rediscover from a starting point
<ul>
<li>That's why it's like climbing a mountain, learning to navigate</li>
<li>Not memorizing or ticking off a list</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>The more i do this, I realize that it is important skill to be familiar with concepts and ideas that you have learned and picked up and to internalize them</h2>

<ul>
<li>So how can you be better at it?</li>
</ul>

<h2>I think it is important to note how you are doing and feeling while you are progressing in the activity of studying</h2>

<ul>
<li>So you can adjust patterns and optmize yourself for growth</li>
</ul>

<h2>I notice that after a prolonged time by brain has difficulty slowly going through and holding ideas my head</h2>

<ul>
<li>And I just want to rush things</li>
<li>What can I do in this case?
<ul>
<li>Rest relax</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>Breathe, blood flow, the brain is organ which has physical requirements</h2>

<h2>When a new value with equality is introduced, what set of operations can be used to form it. is it unique?</h2>

<h2>Slow down</h2>

<ul>
<li>Sometimes you need to warm up </li>
</ul>

<h2>FOCUS</h2>

<ul>
<li>What gives you this focus</li>
<li>being able to forgo the other issues worries and fears</li>
<li>Safety in trust of God</li>
<li>Purpose and a goal. Tunnel Visioning</li>
<li>Some times its not good to too narrowly tunnel</li>
</ul>

<h2>Fun</h2>

<ul>
<li>Why is it that when I play I feel like I am having so much fun?
<ul>
<li>And that I am drawn to it over and over again?</li>
<li>Some idea of fantasy that you are</li>
<li>Social recognition?</li>
<li>No consequence?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Not Fun
<ul>
<li>Why do you get upset and irritable?</li>
<li>Its not really a comfortable position</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>When something is inconvinient can you find a better or more compact representation?</h2>

<ul>
<li>Bijections are difficult to construct every time to show countability, so develop implications or conditions that can extend the countability</li>
</ul>

<h2>Creating the mood</h2>

<ul>
<li>Do you ever notice, when you clean out place before leaving, you work in a state of frenzy trance calm</li>
<li>Or when preparing before an exam, without the pressure or the stress you study the best</li>
<li>You seem to study well when there is well defined, physical, pressure</li>
</ul>

<h2>From a new idea, how many more ideas can be formed in combination with existing ideas?</h2>

<ul>
<li>Set of existing ideas = [ identity, inverse, transitive, union, intersection, equality, less than or equal, subset ]</li>
<li>What does each concept interact with?</li>
<li>Equivalence</li>
<li>To facilitate this naturally, when you see each symbol and component, be mindful of it's full definition and what each component interacts with</li>
</ul>

<h2>In order to start thinking about something, you need context. What kinds of context do you need?</h2>

<ul>
<li>Also, when writing and recording ideas how can you limit and minize the context?</li>
<li>context/overhead</li>
</ul>

<h2>Thinking is also like lifting. Before you start, you need proper bracing and have the relevant ideas in place</h2>

<ul>
<li>Without this, it is wasted or poorly invested effort. whatever is worth doing is worth doing poorly </li>
<li>(but it is also worth trying to do with the proper form whatever that is)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Sometimes when I study, i get tired. How can i rest and recover? from a mental fatigue</h2>

<ul>
<li>Is it similar to resting for a workout?</li>
</ul>

<h2>What does this mean? What good properties arise from this</h2>

<h2>Go through the material slowly do not rush it</h2>

<ul>
<li>Or finish it as an attempt to check off a list of things or list of facts to learn</li>
<li>You need to have the basics down</li>
</ul>

<h2>What kinds of things should I look into and are scalable?</h2>

<pre><code>* Whichever you learn, make sure to organize the material well so that it can be abstracted and extended
* ask lots of questions
</code></pre>

<h2>Mantra</h2>

<ul>
<li>You are a musician with the barbell or the material</li>
<li>Even though it is hard, I will do it</li>
<li>FOCUS</li>
<li>Relax and throw punches, rest and try again</li>
<li>Studying is like training</li>
</ul>

<h2>What is the end goal?</h2>

<ul>
<li>Need some reward </li>
<li>To be able to learn, explore, organize, and communicate them in an effective way</li>
<li>Speed</li>
<li>Strength</li>
<li>Art, Beauty</li>
</ul>

<h2>Mapping out the space</h2>

<ul>
<li>How about the converse?</li>
<li>How does this relate to what we already know?</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>How is this scenario similar to working out?</li>
<li>You gotta be chill and focused</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>solving problems, pushing prs, while great, isn't the status quo</p>

<ul>
<li>dont you wish you were back at it solving problems thinking about theorems and implications?</li>
<li>What does it mean to be fresh and the map out the area again?</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>You cannot just passively chase some goal</p>

<ul>

<li>Work on train of thought and focus</li>
<li>How to progress</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>When trying to decide whether something is true or false, work through the possibilities and see if each step contradics the given facts</p>

<ul>
<li>for example consider the normal sets \( A /delta B /delta G\) is A normal in G?</li>
<li>Well does \(gAg^-1\) return to A? \(gBg^-1\) returns to B and \(bAb^-1\) returns to A. If g in \(gAg^-1\) is not in B, there is nothing which stops it from being in \(B/A\)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>What is interest? It is when I can keep thinking about the idea in my head</p></li>

<li>What inspires you to learn, understand?</li>
<li>Do we really need to spend time learning this?</li>
<li>What are we studying here? Knowledge acquisition and internalization</li>
<li>What are the key themes?</li>
<li>What are you curious about? </li>
<li>Why is it interesting/significant?</li>
<li><p>What is narrative, progression?</p></li>
<li><p>What is a good way to make sure I can understand the old material/theorma I learned quickly?</p>

<li>If something is worth doing, it is worth doing badly</li>
</ul>

<h1>STUCK</h1>

<ul>
<li>So we were stuck on permutation
<ul>
<li>Do we have to learn it?</li>
<li>Can we skip it?</li>
<li>Always question the issues you are dealing with from every angle.
<ul>
<li>Write about it, talk about it, think about it, feel about it in the hopes the answer will come to you</li>
