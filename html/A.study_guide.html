<ul>
<li>for example consider the normal sets \( A /delta B /delta G\) is A normal in G?</li>
<li>Well does \(gAg^-1\) return to A? \(gBg^-1\) returns to B and \(bAb^-1\) returns to A. If g in \(gAg^-1\) is not in B, there is nothing which stops it from being in \(B/A\)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>What is interest? It is when I can keep thinking about the idea in my head</p></li>

<li>Breathe</li>
<li><p>Enjoy the present/process journey, not the destination</p></li>
<li><p>Dont feel pride in what you accomplish because that will ruin the fun in the long run</p>

<ul>
<li>Be content and happy for just exploring. Imagine you are surfing and you take pride in 'oh I surfed that big wave, or oh I'm so better than others', you'll not enjoy the moment...</li>
<li>Men must be taught as if you taught them not And things unknown proposed as things forgot</li>
<li>You cannot teach a man anything; you can only help him to find it within himself</li>

<li>One thing only I know, and that is that I know nothing. </li>

<li>What are the key themes?</li>
<li>What are you curious about? </li>
<li>Why is it interesting/significant?</li>
<li><p>What is narrative, progression?</p></li>
<li><p>What is a good way to make sure I can understand the old material/theorma I learned quickly?</p>

<ul>
<li>This is a good question, i think there is no other way but to dig deep.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>What is the desired end goal?</p>

<ul>
<li>Scratch Paper -> Write Journal Log</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Rewrite Notes Blind
<ul>
<li>Scratch Paper -> Write Journal Log</li>
</ul></li>
<li>(Research) Questions, (Research) Problems</li>
</ul>

<h1>Motivation</h1>

<ul>
<li>Internal vs External Motivation</li>
<li>Inspiration
<ul>
<li>Find reasons why it is interesting</li>
