<li>Not memorizing or ticking off a list</li>
</ul></li>

<ul>
<li>for example consider the normal sets \( A /delta B /delta G\) is A normal in G?</li>
<li>Well does \(gAg^-1\) return to A? \(gBg^-1\) returns to B and \(bAb^-1\) returns to A. If g in \(gAg^-1\) is not in B, there is nothing which stops it from being in \(B/A\)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>What is interest? It is when I can keep thinking about the idea in my head</p></li>

</ul></li>
<li><p>Progression? What would you like to become?</p></li>
<li>Breathe</li>
<li><p>Enjoy the present/process journey, not the destination</p></li>
<li><p>Dont feel pride in what you accomplish because that will ruin the fun in the long run</p>

<ul>
<li>Be content and happy for just exploring. Imagine you are surfing and you take pride in 'oh I surfed that big wave, or oh I'm so better than others', you'll not enjoy the moment...</li>
<li>Men must be taught as if you taught them not And things unknown proposed as things forgot</li>
<li>You cannot teach a man anything; you can only help him to find it within himself</li>

<li>One thing only I know, and that is that I know nothing. </li>
<li>Thereâ€™s magic, positive magic, in such phrases as: "I may be wrong. I frequently am. Letâ€™s examine the facts.</li>

</ul></li>
<li><p>Find a perspective that makes you want to do things instead of having to do them</p></li>

<li>Do we really need to spend time learning this?</li>
<li>What are we studying here? Knowledge acquisition and internalization</li>
<li>What are the key themes?</li>
<li>What are you curious about? </li>
<li>Why is it interesting/significant?</li>
<li><p>What is narrative, progression?</p></li>
<li><p>What is a good way to make sure I can understand the old material/theorma I learned quickly?</p>

<ul>
<li>This is a good question, i think there is no other way but to dig deep.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>What is the desired end goal?</p>

<ul>
<li>Scratch Paper -> Write Journal Log</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Rewrite Notes Blind
<ul>
<li>Scratch Paper -> Write Journal Log</li>
</ul></li>
<li>(Research) Questions, (Research) Problems</li>
</ul>

<h1>Motivation</h1>

<ul>
<li>Internal vs External Motivation</li>
<li>Inspiration
<ul>
<li>Find reasons why it is interesting</li>
<li>I want to see the connections and how it works and understand it :)</li>

<ul>
<li>So we were stuck on permutation
<ul>
<li>Do we have to learn it?</li>
<li>Can we skip it?</li>
<li>Always question the issues you are dealing with from every angle.
<ul>
<li>Write about it, talk about it, think about it, feel about it in the hopes the answer will come to you</li>
