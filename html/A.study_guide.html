<h1>Free notes</h1>

<h2>From mess to clarity</h2>

<ul>
<li>Mess and mucking around and headaches.. for 4 days</li>
<li>Emergence of clarity after finding the right 'mindset' of artist painting</li>
<li>Big factor of this was me not group concepts together into functions and instead just applying things randomly in a process</li>
<li><strong>Group concepts together, isolate input and outputs</strong></li>
<li>Also a key idea is that you weren't sure how to create the end effect to begin with
<ul>
<li>Which means, you needed to experiment more
<ul>
<li><strong>But you need to structure your experimentation</strong>
<ul>
<li>With varied pathways and common processes that will help you cut down on time</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Math, especially my MAPranaly is similar to program for the mind. 
<ul>
<li>It is a way of grouping concepts together to describe something or see what can come out</li>
<li>It is a story, an art</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>Re organize</h2>

<ul>
<li>I think at least once a month, I should spend time to reorganize and regroup</li>
</ul>

<h2>Health and thinking</h2>

<ul>
<li>Breathe, get that oxygen to your body</li>
<li>Take care of yourself, your well-being influences how you can think and perform</li>
<li>Adapt evolve be hungry and squeeze every last bit of juice out of life</li>
<li>Why do people say, you need to discover or do something in your prime?</li>
<li>Maintain/manage the prime</li>
</ul>

<h2>Brain tired, overworked, Rest</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Overworked</p>

<ul>
<li>I am not sure where this feeling came from...
<ul>
<li>I think I saw some other people ahead of where I was and I felt like I was falling behind so I wanted to put in this effort to 'catch up'</li>
<li>And so I didn't really take care of myself, because nothing matter more than (getting it done, putting the flag in, and finishing)</li>
<li>But this isn't true in life. Something else will come</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Make a promise, that you will never feel like you are behind. and work at your own pace</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>DO i need rest?</p>

<ul>
<li>headache</li>
<li>Lack of alertness, brain slowing down</li>
</ul></li>
<li>I think there is a problem with your approach causing you headaches and tiredness</li>
<li>While you do need rest if your conditions are not improving, try to see what caused this issue in the first place.
<ul>
<li>You kept ramming at the solution without a constructive approach and really thinking about what it was you were doing</li>
<li>Need to create a systematic axiom to manage your thought like in math</li>
<li>Like, you are adding things together to create a blend, you need to analyze that and figure out if it holds true... etc</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Mindset and attitude
<ul>
<li>Should be towards making something which makes sense and whole</li>
<li>Not towards just making something happen just for the sake of it
<ul>
<li>This is why you were feeling like you were frustrated because you wanted to finish (without understanding)</li>
<li>You wanted to 'just do it' without really understanding or creating a good system</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Some of the ideas you came up with were good but they were some general directions, you need to sit down and thik about the core of the problem
<ul>
<li>I kept putting it off</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>Implementation</h2>

<ul>
<li>Implement in the simplest way before trying to optimize</li>
<li>Simplicity of code is better than faster optimization with more complexity</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>As soon as your head hurts/feels uncomfortable stop</strong></h2>

<ul>
<li>And try to find a more efficient better way to approach the problem</li>
<li>it is extremely draining and not good for your energy reserves</li>
</ul>

<h2>Health and Focus</h2>

<ul>
<li>Need to exercise to keep the blood flowing and keep yourself alert and agile</li>
<li>This is something you should not sacrifice</li>
</ul>

<h2>Head hurting?</h2>

<ul>
<li>eye pain?</li>
<li>What you likely are experiencing is stress and strain resulting from negative thoughts and emotions regarding the difficulty and/or inconvenience of studying whatever it is you are trying to learn</li>
<li>Relax and stop beating yourself up for not knowing or learning the material as fast as you think you should.</li>
<li>Accept the fact that you must spend time doing the studying and thank yourself for doing the work.</li>
<li>Treat yourself with the same respect, tolerance and acceptance that you would show another person.</li>
<li><p>I suspect that when you concentrate like that you are unconsciously tensing the muscles in your head and neck leading to a tension headache. These are felt inside your head, thus the feeling that your brain hurt</p>

<h3>stress, frustration ?</h3></li>
<li><p>You dont take interest in your subjects.</p></li>
<li>You are setting long targets and at the end u are unable to achieve it, and get frustrated or may be u are not setting your targets.</li>
<li>May be,you dont have a sound environment for studies and u get distracted.</li>
<li>You think that u can study for long hours(say 4–5) continuously which isnt possible my friend.</li>
</ul>

<h2>how is math diff from programming</h2>

<ul>
<li>math is more about exploring, (sometimes there isn't a goal)
<ul>
<li>Looking at the consequences of something, defining</li>
</ul></li>
<li>pgramming has a very specific goal you want to achieve
<ul>
<li>And the art is identifying/breaking down common workflows into a series</li>
<li>I think you should practice this more ina more abstract workflow sense</li>
<li>Must be aware of performance as well (This is quite big...)
<ul>
<li>often times I cannot think in the most simple way because of performance considerations</li>
<li>Then what happens is that I end up </li>
<li><em>*building a tool that abstracts the thing in a simple away but is implemented in a efficient way *</em></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>Tasks to refresh your mind</h2>

<ul>
<li>Try different mediums, techniques
<ul>
<li>Paper, listening, oratory, typing, presenting</li>
<li>Limit cognitive overload</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>Always seek opportunity to reduce, simplify</h2>

<ul>
<li>It helps to clarify the mind</li>
</ul>

<h2>Who are you?</h2>

<ul>
<li>I am a warrior it is a part of me to be strong, brave, courageous</li>
<li>I am also weak, afraid</li>
<li>It is a core part of my identity</li>
</ul>

<h2>My lack of ability to remember or organize as strongly as others</h2>

<ul>
<li>blind-wandering fool, maybe my lack of strong-memory, tendency to forget is an advantage</li>
<li>being able to approach things anew</li>
<li><p>Things of most signifiance strike out at me</p>

<h2>questions/problems and workflow examples</h2></li>
<li><p>Help to expand and explore the consequences of your definitions</p></li>
<li>Directing your thought towards something specific</li>
<li>guide and help to verify your set of rules</li>
<li>Even if the set of rules change, the problems are stable. 
<ul>
<li>And you can try to prove if the property/question remain under the new rules</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Realized this while setting up different rules/definitions for server</li>
</ul>

<h2>Unhinge yourself from the limitations set by yourself</h2>

<ul>
<li>Be realistic, but dont be held back by limitations</li>
</ul>

<h2>I often cannot find myself or find it difficult to stop thinking about the</h2>

<ul>
<li>game emchanics and state and what not, specific examples, different cases, running throught the scenario in my mind</li>
<li>How can similar thing be achieved for mathematics?</li>
<li>Play. It is just play. What is fun about math? What is interesting about math.</li>
<li>You have treated as a means to a goal, like prestiege or tool for AI, understanding etc...</li>
<li>But what is fun about math? How can you play math? It is like a game with rules</li>
</ul>

<h2>Big part on working and perservering</h2>

<ul>
<li>If you believe you can do it, you probably can do it, even when it is difficult
<ul>
<li>Looking at examples really helped me come to a good point with the collision system, ilooked at ap3, push ralph, and simple pusher example</li>
<li>If you get frustrated, need to manage it better</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Frustration is difficult to overcome, its a skill</li>
<li>Manage your ambition and expectations by setting clear goals and checkpoints and review them</li>
<li>Make sure you rest, and get plenty of sleep
<ul>
<li>Be comfortable when you are working ( This chair is extremely uncomfortable )</li>
</ul></li>
<li>When developing and trying to make a good system, ask questions not write tasks todo</li>
<li>When refactoring, take those questions into consideration and answer all of thsoe questions in a unified system</li>
<li>What are the questions we had when we were developing this engine?</li>
<li>Whatever your goal is, work hard towards it, with your heart and body and soul and also keep these poitns/questions in mind</li>
</ul>

<h2>Fight or Flight response and heart beating under stress and pressure</h2>

<ul>
<li>Focus your mentality and mind and soul</li>
<li>Maybe its the voice in your head saying you MUST solve it</li>
</ul>

<h2>Interesting theorems? Great and beautiful?</h2>

<ul>
<li>https://mathoverflow.net/questions/412437/breakthroughs-in-mathematics-in-2021</li>
</ul>

<h2>Reading it voraciously</h2>

<ul>
<li>More efficient way to get at the core of your goal</li>
<li>This previous approach is too time consuming</li>
</ul>

<h2>When you are frustrated</h2>

<ul>
<li>You often don't see the obvious solution</li>
<li>You are training to see the correction solution, so be patient </li>
<li>map out and work through all the possibilities</li>
<li>Mathematics is also clerical work (when you get stuck and are branching out)</li>
</ul>

<h2>On improving and getting better</h2>

<ul>
<li>As long as you can see how you are improving or see some direction in which you can improve, it is good</li>
<li>Sometimes you may not see it at all.</li>
</ul>

<h2>RP Sim</h2>

<ul>
<li>achieved my childhood lifelong dream, in a span of 2 weeks
<ul>
<li>Some lessons to take away is, think plan and then just try. if you are not sure, just try and see how else you need to improve</li>
<li>Another big lesson that was affecting me is ont to get externally motivated.
<ul>
<li>I was getting legit jitters from my dopamine system</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Utilizing a todo list</li>
<li>A big thing that I need to work on is how to safely distance myself and not burn out
<ul>
<li>I could have arrived at the goal later, tomm, but I choose to keep working late into the night. This isnt really healthy
<ul>
<li>need clear boundaries ( Where do we form the boundaries?)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>And focus on other objectives</li>
<li>I found myself tunneling too deep in this genre and unable to work on other things, workout, relax, sleep, math</li>
<li>Good work takes time but try to break it up into chunks to manage better (organization)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>I found that when I encountered a difficult problem it was more productive to laydown and think about it and then try again</li>
<li>And to conclude, I sincerely congratulate you on your efforts</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to be patient</h2>

<ul>
<li>Be committed to seeing the situation through</li>
<li>Or you will go insane</li>
</ul>

<h2>So what helps you to work out</h2>

<ul>
<li>Just do it</li>
<li>Raw, Emotional</li>
<li>Why is it different</li>
</ul>

<h2>Problem solving in a RL</h2>

<ul>
<li>RL problem solve
<ul>
<li>Infinite action space (Reduce it)</li>
<li>Reframing statement that is too hard (to an intermediate step)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Your notes should be in a format that 
<ul>
<li>reduces action space</li>
<li>breaks up big statements into smaller steps</li>
<li>clearly reflect this</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>Good will</h2>

<ul>
<li>Be generous have good will when dealing with people</li>
<li>good will - friendly, helpful, cooperation feelings or attitude</li>
<li>Be tactful and mericiless when dealing with objects</li>
</ul>

<h2>Stress</h2>

<ul>
<li>Stress is like a heavy glass of water</li>
<li>The longer you hold onto it the more heavy it is </li>
<li>Control not being affected by stress, or other things. This is a skill</li>
</ul>

<h2>Intrinsic Motivation</h2>

<ul>
<li>Make sure you are careful to not attach too much to the extrinsic motivation</li>
<li>The Process is more than the Result</li>
</ul>

<h2>Notation</h2>

<ul>
<li>Use wording or symbolic notation?</li>
<li>I think wording has much more flexibilty, the symbols are words themselves</li>
</ul>

<h2>How do I make myself</h2>

<ul>
<li>feel in good condition?</li>
<li>ambitious and energetic?</li>
<li>what drains my energy?</li>
<li>self-care</li>
<li>exercise? routine</li>
</ul>

<h2>Stress and mental fatigue</h2>

<ul>
<li>There is no such thing as mental tireness</li>
<li>It is stress that causes this</li>
<li>Remove yourself from the forms of stress</li>
<li>Its bad, non-optimal for thinking</li>
</ul>

<h2>New style of notetaking 2</h2>

<ul>
<li>Kind of feels redundant, I want to separate it out better</li>
<li>I dont think I should repeat, maybe keep the oringal notes for 
<ul>
<li>Examples</li>
<li>Proof</li>
<li>Extended Discussion</li>
</ul></li>
<li>And keep the second one as just MAP and links of ideas</li>
<li>As you work from MAP, you may need to prune some stuff over</li>
</ul>

<h2>A new style of note taking</h2>

<ul>
<li>In general, keep the things as simple as possible </li>
<li>Adding a high level view of just definitions and connections</li>
</ul>

<h2>Stress</h2>

<ul>
<li>Breathe</li>
<li>Mental fatigue is caused by stress</li>
<li>Stay low, steely and calm</li>
<li>Don't be committed or invested or emotional</li>
<li>How can you? Faith in God</li>
<li>Thanks and trust</li>
<li>Just try and practice</li>
<li>Nerves of Steel
<ul>
<li>Ability to remain calm under pressure or difficult situations</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>Dont muck your way through thought. It is form</h2>

<h2>Math study</h2>

<ul>
<li>Should think of different ways the objects can interact</li>
<li>While studying ask questions on try to branch out in simple areas. what should come next?</li>
</ul>

<h2>You really need to push yourself to grow</h2>

<ul>
<li>with thinking</li>
<li>Who do you wish to become?
<ul>
<li>How can you grow sharper, simpler, persistent, </li>
<li>You need to train and rest</li>
</ul></li>
<li>programming</li>
</ul>

<h2>Exploratory Creative Drive</h2>

<ul>
<li>Valheim:</li>
<li>Progression. I had a clear idea of what I wanted to become</li>
<li>Knew Vaguely what I needed and it was right ahead of me</li>
<li>Motivated me really well</li>
<li>Kepth going and going and absoring all sorts of information</li>
<li>Was really simple: I had some idea of what I needed to do</li>
</ul>

<h2>Competitive Drive</h2>

<ul>
<li>Can only compete well for short about of time</li>
<li>Simple and Optimize</li>
</ul>

<h2>To be able to think clearly</h2>

<ul>
<li>You must be mindful of the basic elements involved</li>
<li>This is very important</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why do I feel rushed. And feel like I am just skipping over details...</h2>

<ul>
<li>I feel like the previous days, I have not been working as hard as I should have</li>
<li>And to compensate I am trying to work extra hard</li>
<li>But you know, as with lifting, such a thing is not possible to achieve without sacrificing quality</li>
<li>Keep the quality
<ul>
<li>And be consistent</li>
<li>Use the feeling to make sure you are more consistent in the future</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Can't peak, need to be more consistent with your efforts in the long run
<ul>
<li>As with lifting, heavy sets followed by volume, perfect the form</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>At a point when you feel like you are slowing down.</h2>

<ul>
<li>If you need to move ahead, feel free to do so</li>
<li>Like working through an exam </li>
<li>what is the catch, that the stuff ahead doesn't depend on the previous material</li>
<li>I have mastered all of the material
<ul>
<li>Think, work, and sweat through every combination of ideas</li>
<li>Of course it is not easy!</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>Need to make sure I am thinking through the thing I read</h2>

<ul>
<li>I can do this by closing the book and recalling it in my memory</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why did I get stuck in this area for some time?</h2>

<ul>
<li>I think it was fine, the progression of ideas to prove this</li>
<li>Just needed to not get lost in the details and keep track of the big steps</li>
<li>I did feel overwhelmed and tired after making too many jumps without properly writing down the different steps</li>
</ul>

<h2>Sometimes when I write too much, i get lost in the details.</h2>

<ul>
<li>And focus too much on the writing aspect rather than thinking</li>
<li>I believe writing has it's merit but it should be done at key points, not detailing the details</li>
<li>Try to work in your head as much as possible</li>
<li>Also sometimes the latex formatting gets in the way of clearly organizing. 
<ul>
<li>Do keep the clear notes and later reorganize</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>Stop being results driven</h2>

<ul>
<li>just because you make alot of progress or win, it is not a indicator of how well you are doing</li>
<li>because there are too many variables that determine whether you are doing well or not</li>
</ul>

<h2>Sometimes you want to play</h2>

<ul>
<li>I can tell you (math) is one of the purest form of play there is really</li>
<li>Theme like space, underwater?</li>
<li>Anyone can do this, really. Just be dedicated and focused and persistent</li>
<li>Devoted</li>
</ul>

<h2>If your head hurts, go back and review</h2>

<ul>
<li>Update the notes and clean it up while reviewing</li>
<li>To make the review a pleasant process, take good notes</li>
</ul>

<h2>Look carefully at each statement, example, problem</h2>

<ul>
<li>And consider the possibilities and variations in it's statement</li>
<li>For example \((0,1/n) and (0,\inf)\)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Need continued inspiration</h2>

<ul>
<li>Faith</li>
<li>Motivation</li>
</ul>

<h2>When introduced with new object \(X\)</h2>

<ul>
<li>\(X R X\)</li>
<li>\(X + X\)
<ul>
<li>Special objects in the operation?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>\(X R X \rightarrow X Q X\)</li>
<li>function?</li>
</ul>

<h2>Exercises</h2>

<ul>
<li>Before I looked at exercises as just something I needed to prove and be done with</li>
<li>Now I see them as perspectives, points of view</li>
<li>And after one is resolved, I think, what is the implication, consequences of this?
<ul>
<li>How does this shift the way I can think about the objects</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>Ok, so I learned some considerable amount of information</h2>

<ul>
<li>How can I make them so they become second nature?</li>
<li>I feel like I am working through to 'prove' them again from scratch</li>
<li>Need to summarize what I learned in a common/natural sense way</li>
</ul>

<h2>Relax. Dont be anxious, its no way to live life.</h2>

<ul>
<li>Enjoy the process</li>
<li>Inspect each step</li>
<li>Take your time and make sure it is spent meaningfully</li>
</ul>

<h2>Hints are dangerous</h2>

<ul>
<li>need a proper reason to arrive at the solution</li>
<li>I had assumed \(x_1  <  x_2  <  x_3 ...\) when it was \(\{ x_1, x_2, x_3 \}\), leading me towards a wrong solution</li>
<li>Consider the most basic facts and lay them out</li>
<li>Assumptions are fine as long as you know they are assumptions and are willing to forgo</li>
</ul>

<h2>Dont aim to learn everything, learn to think and work through, the process</h2>

<h2>Exercise</h2>

<ul>
<li>To come up with potential good question that investigate connections.
<ul>
<li>And the solve these questions</li>
</ul></li>
<li>To come up with good examples</li>
<li>What kind of thing can help with building something like this?
<ul>
<li>Like a list of definitions and their input and output and descriptions/interactions/behavior and theorems</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>Lets break down definition supremum</h2>

<ul>
<li>\(sup S\) is a upper bound of \(S\)</li>
<li>if u is upper bound of \(S\), then \(sup S \leq u\)</li>
<li>What are the inputs that define supremum? (S set)</li>
<li>What are the output of the definition? (real value)</li>
<li>Can anything other than input output influence or server some connection?</li>
</ul>

<h2>In terms of time, right now things are easy</h2>

<ul>
<li>But later on its more difficult you should still set some timeline to make sure you don't slip</li>
<li>And also you need practice for when it is difficult </li>
<li>It doesn't have to be perfect but some sembalance of mastery is ok</li>
</ul>

<h2>There is a distinct difference VS</h2>

<ul>
<li>working out a problem loosely in your mind or on scratch</li>
<li>And writing out the formal statement</li>
<li>Make sure you are good on both and not get to focused on one aspect</li>
</ul>

<h2>When you dont feel motivated... what should you do?</h2>

<ul>
<li>Why you feel this way.</li>
<li>How can you change the way you feel?</li>
<li>I want to have fun</li>
<li>Just stay bored, day dream</li>
</ul>

<h2>Your routine, will define you who become</h2>

<ul>
<li>Do you remember when you used to exercise in the beginning? At DePauw or at Mizzou?</li>
<li>You spent a similar amount of time at the gym
<ul>
<li>How are you different then and now?, its the routine, exercise I spend doing.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>What kinds of routine or exercise can you do?</h2>

<ul>
<li>Manipulating ideas in your mind</li>
<li>Metric: Time, Steps, No of Ideas, No of Connections, Memory/Mindfulness, Familiarity/Recall
<ul>
<li>Time per task, assess how many effort it took</li>
<li>Go through each new idea and see if you can slowly see the potential connection</li>
<li>Move through the ideas in your head</li>
<li>How can you effectively learn new ideas and become familar with them?</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>When you learn a new definition:</h2>

<ul>
<li>Deconstruct it. play with it</li>
<li>Try to form connections to other existing nodes of knowledge</li>
<li>I think this will help to solidify the definition into your memory and mind</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to objectively track your mental skill?</h2>

<ul>
<li>What indicators can you track?
<ul>
<li>Time</li>
<li>No of ideas, steps
<ul>
<li>No of interconnected ideas</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Familiarity (New vs Old)</li>
<li>Parallel comparison between lifting, weight, rep, sets, form, </li>
<li>A realization i had with lifting is that the combinations of lifts that you build up, the routine is eventually what will make your physique</li>
</ul></li>
<li>How can you improve these areas? Practice and continued challenge</li>
</ul>

<h2>There is a meaningful meaning why something is the case. carefully search for it</h2>

<h2>You have to be comfortable in your own skin to be able to think freely</h2>

<ul>
<li>To be able to relax and not be anxious</li>
<li>Breathe</li>
</ul>

<h2>Goal is how can I become a better navigator of ideas</h2>

<ul>
<li>Why is it important to have collaries and branch out?
<ul>
<li>To have more interesting perspectives and starting points</li>
</ul></li>
<li>When should you return to an idea?</li>
<li>Practice the technique of finding solution. It is easy to forget ideas but if you have technique you can rediscover from a starting point
<ul>
<li>That's why it's like climbing a mountain, learning to navigate</li>
<li>Not memorizing or ticking off a list</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>The more i do this, I realize that it is important skill to be familiar with concepts and ideas that you have learned and picked up and to internalize them</h2>

<ul>
<li>So how can you be better at it?</li>
</ul>

<h2>I think it is important to note how you are doing and feeling while you are progressing in the activity of studying</h2>

<ul>
<li>So you can adjust patterns and optmize yourself for growth</li>
</ul>

<h2>I notice that after a prolonged time by brain has difficulty slowly going through and holding ideas my head</h2>

<ul>
<li>And I just want to rush things</li>
<li>What can I do in this case?
<ul>
<li>Rest relax</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>Breathe, blood flow, the brain is organ which has physical requirements</h2>

<h2>When a new value with equality is introduced, what set of operations can be used to form it. is it unique?</h2>

<h2>Slow down</h2>

<ul>
<li>Sometimes you need to warm up </li>
</ul>

<h2>FOCUS</h2>

<ul>
<li>What gives you this focus</li>
<li>being able to forgo the other issues worries and fears</li>
<li>Safety in trust of God</li>
<li>Purpose and a goal. Tunnel Visioning</li>
<li>Some times its not good to too narrowly tunnel</li>
</ul>

<h2>Fun</h2>

<ul>
<li>Why is it that when I play I feel like I am having so much fun?
<ul>

<h2>When something is inconvinient can you find a better or more compact representation?</h2>

<ul>
<li>Bijections are difficult to construct every time to show countability, so develop implications or conditions that can extend the countability</li>
</ul>

<h2>Creating the mood</h2>

<ul>
<li>Do you ever notice, when you clean out place before leaving, you work in a state of frenzy trance calm</li>
<li>Or when preparing before an exam, without the pressure or the stress you study the best</li>
<li>You seem to study well when there is well defined, physical, pressure</li>
</ul>

<h2>From a new idea, how many more ideas can be formed in combination with existing ideas?</h2>

<ul>
<li>Set of existing ideas = [ identity, inverse, transitive, union, intersection, equality, less than or equal, subset ]</li>
<li>What does each concept interact with?</li>
<li>Equivalence</li>
<li>To facilitate this naturally, when you see each symbol and component, be mindful of it's full definition and what each component interacts with</li>
</ul>

<h2>In order to start thinking about something, you need context. What kinds of context do you need?</h2>

<ul>
<li>Also, when writing and recording ideas how can you limit and minize the context?</li>
<li>context/overhead</li>
</ul>

<h2>Thinking is also like lifting. Before you start, you need proper bracing and have the relevant ideas in place</h2>

<ul>
<li>Without this, it is wasted or poorly invested effort. whatever is worth doing is worth doing poorly </li>
<li>(but it is also worth trying to do with the proper form whatever that is)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Sometimes when I study, i get tired. How can i rest and recover? from a mental fatigue</h2>

<ul>
<li>Is it similar to resting for a workout?</li>
</ul>

<h2>What does this mean? What good properties arise from this</h2>

<h2>Go through the material slowly do not rush it</h2>

<ul>
<li>Or finish it as an attempt to check off a list of things or list of facts to learn</li>
<li>You need to have the basics down</li>
</ul>

<h2>What kinds of things should I look into and are scalable?</h2>

<pre><code>* Whichever you learn, make sure to organize the material well so that it can be abstracted and extended
* ask lots of questions
</code></pre>

<h2>Mantra</h2>

<ul>
<li>You are a musician with the barbell or the material</li>
<li>Even though it is hard, I will do it</li>
<li>FOCUS</li>
<li>Relax and throw punches, rest and try again</li>
<li>Studying is like training</li>
</ul>

<h2>What is the end goal?</h2>

<ul>
<li>Need some reward </li>
<li>To be able to learn, explore, organize, and communicate them in an effective way</li>
<li>Speed</li>
<li>Strength</li>
<li>Art, Beauty</li>
</ul>

<h2>Mapping out the space</h2>

<ul>
<li>How about the converse?</li>
<li>How does this relate to what we already know?</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>for example consider the normal sets \( A /delta B /delta G\) is A normal in G?</li>
<li>Well does \(gAg^-1\) return to A? \(gBg^-1\) returns to B and \(bAb^-1\) returns to A. If g in \(gAg^-1\) is not in B, there is nothing which stops it from being in \(B/A\)</li>
</ul></li>

</ul></li>
<li>Rewrite Notes Blind
<ul>
<li>Scratch Paper -> Write Journal Log</li>
</ul></li>

<ul>
<li>So we were stuck on permutation
<ul>
<li>Do we have to learn it?</li>

<li>Always question the issues you are dealing with from every angle.
<ul>
<li>Write about it, talk about it, think about it, feel about it in the hopes the answer will come to you</li>
