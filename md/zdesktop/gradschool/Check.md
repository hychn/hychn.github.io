  * leadership experience and practice presenting technical information
  * Describe teaching experience, which you interacted with students or mentored your peers.
    * During my Master's degree, I was a teaching assistant for College Algebra (Math 1100) and Calculus for Social and Life Sciences I (Math 1400). I was responsible for lecturing, creating quizzes, proctoring,  exams,  grading exams,  and holding office hours. The lectures were 50 minutes, three times a week. Each lecture consisted of explanations and applications of key concepts and theorems. Quizzes were conducted bi-weekly and were designed to evaluate students' understanding of key concepts. When I was preparing for lectures and quizzes, I placed emphasis to teach in a way that would encourage students to grow into independent, critical thinkers. Each key concept was presented in its simplest form. Then, the class was encouraged to decide and provide a reason for which key concepts to apply for each problem.
  * Teaching experience, describe a specific instance when you helped your student/students overcome a misunderstanding or understand a difficult concept. If you do not have any teaching experience, describe an oral presentation or talk you gave that explains a particularly difficult concept. 250 words max.
    * The derivative of a function is a difficult and foreign concept to understand. First, the motivations behind the definition of the derivative are explained in terms of knowledge that students are already familiar with. Students are familiar with the definition of points and slope, so we say: the derivative is the slope of two function points, that are very close to each other on the x-axis. Second, a specific, concrete example is demonstrated. We take f(x)=x*x and observe how the slope of two closer function points centered at x=0 converge towards the slope of the tangent line at x=0. We do the same for x=2,  x=-3, and other values. Third, we apply the definition of the derivative to f(x)=x*x and evaluate the derivative, 2x. Although students are not familiar with the formal definition of limits, they understand that the limit will make the two function points closer to each other on the x-axis. The derivative value 2x is verified to be consistent with the concrete examples we solved in the previous step.
