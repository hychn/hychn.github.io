* DEF k-simplex: convex hull of k+1 points in affinely independent
* DEF n points are affinely independent: $ x_2-x_1, x_3-x_1, ..., x_n-x_1$ are linearly independent
* Affinely independent implies no 3 points are colinear
* Affinely independent around x1 implies affinely independent around x_i
* Kind of gives you a perspective on the edges which can form in a k-simplex 
* DEF face: simplex from subset of these points is called the face of the simplex
* DEF simplicial complex: set K of simplexs such that
  * face of any simplex in K is in K
  * interesection of 2 simplexes is a face in both of them
* DEF Abstract Simplicial Complex is a set K of a fixed set F
  * $K = \{ S | S \subset F \}$
  * For $ A \in K$, $ S \subset A \implies S \in K$

* DEF k-chain: vector space over field $\iZ / 2\iZ$ with basis given by k-simplexs of simplicial complex
* DEF K boundary map: $b_k: C_k \rightarrow C_{k-1}$ given by linear map on basis, if k-1 simplex is a face of the k-simplex
* DEF k-cycles: x, k-chain such that $b_k(x)=0$
* DEF k-boundaries: $x \in IM(b_{k+1})$

* $IM(b_{k+1}) \subset KER(b_{k})$
convex hull can be formed with any points
convex hull is unique up to permutation  of the points
there are k unique k-1 face of a k simplex (each face excludes 1 point)
You can write the k-1 faces of ABCD as
ABC, BCD, CDA, DAB 
The consequence k-2 faces are
AB BC BC CD CD DA DA AB
This shows $IM(b_{k+1})$ is in kernel of $b_{k}$


* DIM(A/B) = DIM(A)-DIM(B)
* A L. independent basis that generates a vector space is independently maximal
  * For any LI basis, the subset of basis is also LI. Look at a single additional element
  * additional basis element can be generated by the old basis. then coefficient old basis representation and -1 of new basis element is 0.


* DEF k-homology: $Z_k / B_k $ where $Z_k$ is $KER(b_k)$ and $B_k$ is $IM(b_{k+1})$
* DEF k-betti number: $DIM( Z_k / B_k)$
