# 1.1 Sets and Functions

  Consider $f$ and $A$ and $f(A)$. What is the identity? Can there always be an inverse? 
No, consider $f(x)=x^2$ and $ A = \{ 0 \leq x \leq 1 \}$. We see that $f^{-1}(f(A)) = \{ -1 \leq x \leq 1 \}$. 
What condition can guarantee that you can always find an inverse?

  From a new idea, how many more ideas can be formed in combination with existing ideas?
Set of existing ideas = [ identity, inverse, transitive, union, intersection, equality, less than or equal, subset ]
