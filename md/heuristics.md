* HEUR istics are nice to have
* Like any theorem, its  nice to see the motivating example or situation
* Therefore,  I think you should make an effort to collect heuristics with their context
* You should be precise with how you collect heuristics, to be vague is not really good.
* HEUR should do a specific, tangible thing. And if not, you shouldn't worry about it.
* Finally, as the list of HEUR grows, you should take effort in combining them or looking for common themes
* Perhaps one can form a theory out of them...
