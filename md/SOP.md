* SIMPLE AND TO THE POINT

# Purpose
* Simple, natural ideas that form the answers to difficult, general questions; these are the things that fascinate and bring me great joy.
* When I was building AI that was dealing with images, I was pleased with how simple ideas led to complex behaviors
  * A complex function that would take an image and output an image was constructed by linear combinations of 
    * Simple image processing kernels that can blur, outline, and dialate an image.
    * Combined with non-linear activations.
  * When the difference between the output of the function/desired output was minimized, the function optimize
    * Exhibit complex behaviors such as segment satellite images and identify key points of robotic arm pose from varying perspectives.
* When I was working with input that required more structure,
* Breaking down complex input (like an image of an object in various conformations/perspective or protein sequence) into a latent space and applying some rules in this space
  * Encoding into latent space and performing rotations in image generation
  * Or building protins out of the latent space
* However, while studying there where/was a question which I found difficult to answer
  * How to minimize lost with respect to non-differentiable function
    * Hyper parameter optimization
    * Unsatisfying answer: have to try every combination many times
    * Wish to formulate a more structured answer

# PURPOSE
* Provoking questions and simple, natural ideas that form the answers; these are the things that fascinate and bring me great joy.
* Some of the ideas that I am fond of.
  * Minimizing loss w.r.t to convolution kernels (which are typically used for bluring, outline in image processing) gave way to Convolution Neural Networks, an extremly important type of network.
  * Encoding inputs into a latent space representation to analyze their distributions and combine them to create new output.
  * Invertible neural networks and finding inputs that can create the similar ouputs.
* Some of questions that were difficult and are unanswered. (why?, do these tie into a common theme?)
  * How to optimize parameters that are not differentiable? (hyper parameter optimization (landcover, protein struct losses combined learning rate). Reinforcement Learning)
    * MCST model, what was I doing? adjustments of rollout (prediction of v, rollout using v)
      * iterated rollout
    * (Efficiently train) Sample Efficiency of reinforcement Learning/ML
  * Estimation of function and achieving guarantees optimal cost bound 
  * Auxillary cost and relationship to true cost?
* GOAL
  * Study the questions and related ideas. (how?)
  * Explore and combine simple, natural ideas to answer these questions in theory and practice.
  * Discovery new questions and be able to answer them with training
  * ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  * I hope to explore these questions, break them down into simpler questions, restrict them under meaningful conditions.
  * I hope to study the ideas and their inter-relationship. related to similar questions.
  * ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  * Explore, Reframe, break down/restrict these questions, understand, discovery ideas and the relationships between them.
  * And suggest simple, natural ideas that can answer these questions in practice.
  * Theory-Application
