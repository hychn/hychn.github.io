Simple, natural ideas that answer a variety of questions fascinate and give me great joy.
Minimizing loss w.r.t to convolution kernels (which are typically used for bluring, outline in image processing) gave way to Convolution Neural Networks, an extremly important type of network.
Encoding inputs into a latent space representation to analyze their distributions and combine them to create new output.
Invertible neural networks that can find inputs that can create the similar ouputs.
After my master's degree in AI and Mathematics, I explored, researched, and applied these types of ideas.
I encountered several key questions that were beyond my expertise.
* (optimizing without gradient descent) hyper parameter optimization
* Sample Efficiency of reinforcement Learning
