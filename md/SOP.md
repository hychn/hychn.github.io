* SIMPLE AND TO THE POINT

# Purpose
* General questions and simple, natural ideas that form the answer; these things fascinate and bring me great joy.
* Here are two examples I encountered, while working in the industry for the past three years.
* First, while classifying and segmenting satellite images for a government project, I explored and combined the following simple ideas: Image kernels that can blur, outline, and dialate an image, nonlinear-activation functions, gradient descent to adjust parameters of kernels.
* It was very satistfying seeing such simple ideas work together to classify large areas of terrain accurately and much faster than human annotation.
* Second, when working complex input data with instrinsic structure, I learned to encode the input data to a smaller latent space. Then, the input representation was transformed with respect to the structure. When working with 3D robotic-arm pose in images or 3d structure in 1D protein sequences, these ideas allowed the AI to handle the complex input much more efficiently.

such as 3d structure of protein input sequence and 3d orientation of objects in 2d images.
;I explored the idea of latent space
with input/output data that has instrinsic 



* Exhibit complex behaviors such as segment satellite images and identify key points of robotic arm pose from varying perspectives.
* When I was working with input that required more structure,
* Breaking down complex input (like an image of an object in various conformations/perspective or protein sequence) into a latent space and applying some rules in this space
  * Encoding into latent space and performing rotations in image generation
  * Or building protins out of the latent space
* However, while studying there where/was a question which I found difficult to answer
  * How to minimize lost with respect to non-differentiable function
    * Hyper parameter optimization
    * Unsatisfying answer: have to try every combination many times
    * Wish to formulate a more structured answer

# PURPOSE
* Provoking questions and simple, natural ideas that form the answers; these are the things that fascinate and bring me great joy.
* Some of the ideas that I am fond of.
  * Minimizing loss w.r.t to convolution kernels (which are typically used for bluring, outline in image processing) gave way to Convolution Neural Networks, an extremly important type of network.
  * Encoding inputs into a latent space representation to analyze their distributions and combine them to create new output.
  * Invertible neural networks and finding inputs that can create the similar ouputs.
* Some of questions that were difficult and are unanswered. (why?, do these tie into a common theme?)
  * How to optimize parameters that are not differentiable? (hyper parameter optimization (landcover, protein struct losses combined learning rate). Reinforcement Learning)
    * MCST model, what was I doing? adjustments of rollout (prediction of v, rollout using v)
      * iterated rollout
    * (Efficiently train) Sample Efficiency of reinforcement Learning/ML
  * Estimation of function and achieving guarantees optimal cost bound 
  * Auxillary cost and relationship to true cost?
* GOAL
  * Study the questions and related ideas. (how?)
  * Explore and combine simple, natural ideas to answer these questions in theory and practice.
  * Discovery new questions and be able to answer them with training
  * ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  * I hope to explore these questions, break them down into simpler questions, restrict them under meaningful conditions.
  * I hope to study the ideas and their inter-relationship. related to similar questions.
  * ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  * Explore, Reframe, break down/restrict these questions, understand, discovery ideas and the relationships between them.
  * And suggest simple, natural ideas that can answer these questions in practice.
  * Theory-Application
