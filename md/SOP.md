* SIMPLE AND TO THE POINT

# Purpose ===========================================================================================================
* General questions and simple, natural ideas that form the answer; these things fascinate and bring me great joy.
  * Here are two examples I encountered, while working in the industry for the past three years.
  * First, while classifying and segmenting satellite images for a government project, I explored and combined the following simple ideas: Image kernels that can blur, outline, and dialate an image, nonlinear-activation functions, gradient descent to adjust parameters of kernels.
    * It was very satistfying seeing such simple ideas work together to classify large areas of terrain accurately and much faster than human annotation.
  * Second, when handling complex input data with instrinsic structure, I learned to encode the input data to a smaller latent space. 
    *Then, the input representation was transformed with respect to the structure. 
    * When working with 3D robotic-arm pose in images or 3d structure in 1D protein sequences, these ideas allowed the AI to handle the complex input much more efficiently.

* How do you optimize a parameter that has no derivative? Does a local optimum exist at all?
  * This is a key question that I encountered many times, while finding: 
    * an optimal model architecture for predicting satellite images, loss function for protein structure prediction, different estimations of cost-to-go function in reinforcement learning.
* Searching and estimation by sampling are good, natural ideas that could answer this question.
* However, I was not satisfied with the simple but impractical approach, exhaustive sampling.
* With more specific questions, I wish to explore this key question in more details:
  * Does an optimal solution exist? What are it's characteristics?
  * What different types of sampling and estimation can we form? What are the consequence of using each?
  * Can we measure the quality of the estimation?
  * What interesting situations and conditions are there, where stronger conclusions can follow?

* ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* I hope to explore these questions, break them down into simpler questions, restrict them under meaningful conditions.
* I hope to study the ideas and their inter-relationship. related to similar questions.
* ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Explore, Reframe, break down/restrict these questions, understand, discovery ideas and the relationships between them.
* And suggest simple, natural ideas that can answer these questions in practice.
* Theory-Application

# PURPOSE
* Provoking questions and simple, natural ideas that form the answers; these are the things that fascinate and bring me great joy.
* Some of the ideas that I am fond of.
  * Minimizing loss w.r.t to convolution kernels (which are typically used for bluring, outline in image processing) gave way to Convolution Neural Networks, an extremly important type of network.
  * Encoding inputs into a latent space representation to analyze their distributions and combine them to create new output.
  * Invertible neural networks and finding inputs that can create the similar ouputs.
* Some of questions that were difficult and are unanswered. (why?, do these tie into a common theme?)
  * How to optimize parameters that are not differentiable? (hyper parameter optimization (landcover, protein struct losses combined learning rate). Reinforcement Learning)
    * MCST model, what was I doing? adjustments of rollout (prediction of v, rollout using v)
      * iterated rollout
    * (Efficiently train) Sample Efficiency of reinforcement Learning/ML
  * Estimation of function and achieving guarantees optimal cost bound 
  * Auxillary cost and relationship to true cost?
