* Check what kind of research the professors do, Email professors
* What I'm looking for. Not too strick guidelines/roals
* Have faith in God
* Less time presenting creating image and more time doing

* Good math and ai interdiscplinary program
* Deadline, requirements, 
* CV/personal statement

# Next steps.
* Narrow down your understanding of RL and focus down on the research paths you can go down on...
* Intertwined with mathematics





# THIS IS A KEY REALIZATION
* YOU ALREADY HAVE A MASTERS IN MATH YECHANA
* Alot of what I feel like I wil be doing in Math PhD program is repeating what I have done in MAth MA
  * The only thing you really need is just pass prelim/quals/oral exam etc
* You just need to go to a decent school (in cs)
