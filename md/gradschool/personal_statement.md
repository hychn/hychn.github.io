* personal statement is personal describes you
* The Personal Statement is optional for Computer Science admissions purposes.
* The University of Illinois strives to cultivate graduates and future alumni to be responsible citizens and leaders who value knowledge, creativity, global awareness, and social and cultural understanding. Please use this Personal Statement to describe how your personal background and experiences influenced your decision to pursue a graduate degree.  Provide insight on your potential to contribute to a community of inclusion, belonging, and respect in which scholars with diverse backgrounds, perspectives, abilities, and experiences can learn and collaborate productively and positively together.
* The Personal Statement must be within 500 words. 
(Describe your teamwork in soccer, and at pcadd, share ideas and discuss plans and directions, personal projects, and conversations with friends during talks)

* Generally, the SoP is more structured with you answering more specific questions of why this degree and school are right for you, and the Personal Statement is well, more personal reasons why you want the degree. What drove you to pursue this degree. For example, if you wanted to be a nurse your SoP may include information of how the program your applying to has the best anatomy lab and this understanding will be beneficial to your career. Your Personal Statement may include information like a loved one was in the hospital and the nurses made a big impact on your life that pushed you to pursue a career in nursing.

#TONE 
* As I said earlier, you will write in a professional, straightforward, mature, unemotional, and completely non-melodramatic tone. This isn a creative writing exercise. Its not a screenplay. Its an exercise in clarity and honesty. Dont paint pictures of the difficult scenes in your life. By telling the story straight, youl sound more confident – more like a graduate scholar.

# Statement of Purpose
* https://writeivy.com/structure-is-magic-a-guide-to-the-graduate-sop/
* Most universities only want to know what youll accomplish in the future. They only ask for an SOP, which is 100% academic, a logical argument for why youll make a great chemist, data scientist, or financial engineer.
* This statement should include your goals and background as it relates to the field of computer science. It is good to include any past work history, your interests, and reasons for pursuing a graduate degree in computer science.
* Your statement will be evaluated for your conciseness, reasons for pursuing a graduate degree, leadership skills, and eloquence.  Applicants to our M.S. or Ph.D. program will also be evaluated according to their scientific research interests.
* Generally the Academic Statement of Purpose is between one to two pages.

* Frame Narrative Introduction – 1-2 paragraphs (the story of how we discovered our PURPOSE for graduate study)
* Why This Program – 1-2 paragraphs  (…is the perfect place for me to pursue THIS PURPOSE)
* Why Im Qualified – 1-2 paragraphs  (…to be a grad student pursuing THIS PURPOSE)
* Close Frame Narrative – 1 paragraph  (…and firmly restate our PURPOSE, with gratitude for the chance to pursue it)

  * think and decision to return
  * Hyper parameter searching... how do you know if a model is better than another one? 
    * RL is a difficult problem, but can objectively measure.



* Thus, your goal in writing this essay is to prove that youre someone with big nerdy dreams. Someone whol impact the world, if only in a small way. Someone who has a specific purpose, and who knows what she needs to do to achieve it.
* that way, grad schools will know that you're someone just like them: a focused scholar with big nerdy dreams…and the motivation to achieve them.

* Because thats the secret sauce to the SOP: a single, powerful, focused sentence that 'states' your 'purpose' and gives ad comms a feeling that you're a rock star with unconquerable drive.
* If youve read any of my essay guides, you know that the best SOPs start with a brief story that illustrates your academic curiosities and explains why youre applying to grad school. Its not a silly childhood story. Its not creative writing, and its not a gimmick. Its simply an illustration of how you encountered the problems that you hope to study and solve in grad school. 

* "Why This Program" section. As you describe everything that's awesome about the school, you'll continually emphasize how each professor, class, or lab will push you one more step on the journey toward building those surgical devices.

* "Why Im Qualified" section. All of those good grades and research experiences you've been so eager to describe? They're only useful insofar as they prove you'll succeed in achieving your goal of developing those awesome surgical devices.
