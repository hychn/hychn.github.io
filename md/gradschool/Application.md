    * If you join the PhD program at Washington University, one of the courses you take in your first semester is Introduction to Graduate Study in CSE. As part of this course, you will do two one-month rotations in the research groups of faculty members who are recruiting graduate students. 
    * The rotation model does not preclude students from initiating discussions with faculty whose group they really want to join prior to joining WashU, but it offers the opportunity to be exposed to other research areas and approaches and to interact with potential research advisers before finalizing a commitment.

      * Automated Model Selection with Bayesian Quadrature
        * We present a novel technique for tailoring Bayesian quadrature (BQ) to model selection. The state-of-the-art for comparing the evidence of multiple models relies on Monte Carlo methods, which converge slowly and are unreliable for com- putationally expensive models. Although previ- ous research has shown that BQ offers sample efficiency superior to Monte Carlo in computing the evidence of an individual model, applying BQ directly to model comparison may waste computa- tion producing an overly-accurate estimate for the evidence of a clearly poor model.

    * Professor Lijun Chen's research, 'Incentivized Exploration for Multi-Armed Bandits under Reward Drift', provides ideas related to my key question of qualifying different types of sampling; the paper explores a compensation scheme for UCB, e-Greedy, and Thompson sampling algorithms and demonstrates it's effectiveness by show the regret is similar to the compensation. I really appreciated the style of the paper where the theory was backed up with numerical experiments.
    * Professor Majid Zamani's research, 'Compositional construction of finite MDPs for large-scale stochastic switched systems: A dissipativity approach', constructs an estimation and establishes an upper bound for the error. I am very interested in these types of techniques of simplifying a more complex system and qualifying the simplication.
    * I am also intrested in the statistical machine learning research from the mathematics department; professor Jem Corcoran's research on using importance sampling to manage rare event probabilities partially answers my key questions on how sampling and computational effectiveness.
    * I am looking forward to taking required coursework such as Probabilistic Models of Human and Machine Learning mathematical background and plenty of practical experience neccesary to start research.
