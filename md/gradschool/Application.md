* [University of Colorado Boulder](https://grad.apply.colorado.edu/account/login)
  * [Statement of Purpose](https://www.colorado.edu/cs/admissions/graduate-admissions/how-apply)
    * Colorado doesn't have a seperate section for indicating interest to program so you need to be really clear in this section.
    * Section headers

  * RL [Ashutosh Trivedi](https://astrivedi.github.io/www/pubs.html)
  * SOP why this school is for you, just list of professors
    * Professor Lijun Chen's research, 'Incentivized Exploration for Multi-Armed Bandits under Reward Drift', provides ideas related to my key question of qualifying different types of sampling; the paper explores a compensation scheme for UCB, e-Greedy, and Thompson sampling algorithms and demonstrates it's effectiveness by show the regret is similar to the compensation. I really appreciated the style of the paper where the theory was backed up with numerical experiments.
    * Professor Majid Zamani's research, 'Compositional construction of finite MDPs for large-scale stochastic switched systems: A dissipativity approach', constructs an estimation and establishes an upper bound for the error. I am very interested in these types of techniques of simplifying a more complex system and qualifying the simplication.
    * I am also intrested in the statistical machine learning research from the mathematics department; professor Jem Corcoran's research on using importance sampling to manage rare event probabilities partially answers my key questions on how sampling and computational effectiveness.
    * I am looking forward to taking required coursework such as Probabilistic Models of Human and Machine Learning mathematical background and plenty of practical experience neccesary to start research.
