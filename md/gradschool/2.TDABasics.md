$\def\iZ{\mathbb{Z}}$

* DEF k-simplex: convex hull of k+1 points in general position (no 3 colinear points)
* DEF face: simplex from subset of these points is called the face of the simplex
* DEF simplicial complex: set K of simplexs such that
  * face of any simplex in K is in K
  * interesection of 2 simplexes is a face in both of them
* DEF Abstract Simplicial Complex is a set K of a fixed set F
  * $K = \{ S | S \subset F \}$
  * For $ A \in K$, $ S \subset A \implies S \in K$

* DEF k-chain: vector space over field $\iZ / 2\iZ$ with basis given by k-simplexs of simplicial complex
* DEF K boundary map: $b_k: C_k \rightarrow C_{k-1}$ given by linear map on basis, if k-1 simplex is a face of the k-simplex
* DEF k-cycles: x, k-chain such that $b_k(x)=0$
* DEF k-boundaries: $x \in IM(b_{k+1})$
