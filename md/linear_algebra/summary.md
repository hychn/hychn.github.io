# Dimension
* THM the maximal LI elements generate a vector space
* THM for a finte vector space number of maximal LI elements is unique. We call this the dimension of the vector space
* EX A vector subspace may not share the same basis as the containing set. Consider $\mathbb{R}^2$ whose basis is $(1,0), and (0,1)$ and subspace $k(1,1)$

# Linear map
* $dim(V) = dim(Kerf) + dim(Imf)$
* For every linear map there is a matrix which represents it


# Determinant
* Determinants? A nice way to compare and see the linear dependence/independence of vectors
  * Build it from smaller cases
