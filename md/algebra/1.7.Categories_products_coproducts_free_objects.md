# 1.7 CATEGORIES: PRODUCTS, COPRODUCTS, AND FREE OBJECT

* Several of mathematical objects A already introduced (sets, groups, monoids) (rings, modules) with the appropriate maps of these objects (set:functions, groups:homomorphisms) have a number of formal properties in common.
* For example, composition of maps is associative; each object A has an identity map $1_A :A -> A$ with certain properties.

* DEF Category is a class $\cat{C}$ of objects (A,B,C) with
  * (i) class of disjoint sets, $hom(A,B)$, one for each pair of objects in $\cat{C}$
    * morphism: is $f \in hom(A,B)$  $f:A->B$
  * (ii) for each triple $(A,B,C)$ from $\cat{C}$ a function
    * composition of morphism: $hom(B,C) \times hom(A,B) -> hom(A,C)$ 
      * $f:A->B$, $g:B->C$ $g \circ f$
    * subject to axioms 
    * Associative: for  $f,g, h:C->D$ 
      * $h \o ( g \o f ) = (h \o g) \o f $
    * Identity: for each B of $\cat{C}$ there exists morphism $1_B:B->B$ s.t.
      * for any $f:A->B g:B->A$, 
        * $1_B \cmp f = f$ and $g \cmp 1_B = g$

* DEF a morphism $f$ is __equivalence__ if there is $g$ such that $g \cmp f=1_A$ and $f \cmp  g=1_B$
  * the composite of two equivalences, when defined, is an equivalence
  * if $f:A->B$ is an equivalence, then $A$ and $B$ are __equivalent__

* Let's carefully think about what $1_A$ means 
  * is it the same as an atypical identity? or  are there some restrictions?

* these symbols are kind of frustrating me haha
* Why is the ordering of the hom(A,B) and but the composition is written the other way?
  * hom read right, composition read left
