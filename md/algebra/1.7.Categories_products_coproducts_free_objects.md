# 1.7 CATEGORIES: PRODUCTS, COPRODUCTS, AND FREE OBJECT

* Several of mathematical objects A already introduced (sets, groups, monoids) (rings, modules) with the appropriate maps of these objects (set:functions, groups:homomorphisms) have a number of formal properties in common.
* For example, composition of maps is associative; each object A has an identity map $1_A :A -> A$ with certain properties.

* DEF Category is a class $\cat{C}$ of objects (A,B,C) with
  * (i) class of disjoint sets, $hom(A,B)$, one for each pair of objects in $\cat{C}$
    * morphism is $f \in hom(A,B)$  $f:A->B$
    $A \-> B$
