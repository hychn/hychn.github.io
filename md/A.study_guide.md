# Free notes

## Stress
* Mental fatigue is caused by stress
* Stay low, steely and calm
* Don't be committed or invested or emotional
* How can you? Faith in God
* Thanks and trust
* Just try and practice
* Nerves of Steel
  * Ability to remain calm under pressure or difficult situations

## Dont muck your way through thought. It is form

## Math study
* Should think of different ways the objects can interact
* While studying ask questions on try to branch out in simple areas. what should come next?

## You really need to push yourself to grow
* with thinking
* Who do you wish to become?
  * How can you grow sharper, simpler, persistent, 
  * You need to train and rest
* programming

## Exploratory Creative Drive
* Valheim:
* Progression. I had a clear idea of what I wanted to become
* Knew Vaguely what I needed and it was right ahead of me
* Motivated me really well
* Kepth going and going and absoring all sorts of information
* Was really simple: I had some idea of what I needed to do

## Competitive Drive
* Can only compete well for short about of time
* Simple and Optimize

## To be able to think clearly
* You must be mindful of the basic elements involved
* This is very important

## Why do I feel rushed. And feel like I am just skipping over details...
* I feel like the previous days, I have not been working as hard as I should have
* And to compensate I am trying to work extra hard
* But you know, as with lifting, such a thing is not possible to achieve without sacrificing quality
* Keep the quality
  * And be consistent
  * Use the feeling to make sure you are more consistent in the future
* Can't peak, need to be more consistent with your efforts in the long run
  * As with lifting, heavy sets followed by volume, perfect the form


## At a point when you feel like you are slowing down.
* If you need to move ahead, feel free to do so
* Like working through an exam 
* what is the catch, that the stuff ahead doesn't depend on the previous material
* I have mastered all of the material
  * Think, work, and sweat through every combination of ideas
  * Of course it is not easy!

## Need to make sure I am thinking through the thing I read
* I can do this by closing the book and recalling it in my memory

## Why did I get stuck in this area for some time?
* I think it was fine, the progression of ideas to prove this
* Just needed to not get lost in the details and keep track of the big steps
* I did feel overwhelmed and tired after making too many jumps without properly writing down the different steps

## Sometimes when I write too much, i get lost in the details.
* And focus too much on the writing aspect rather than thinking
* I believe writing has it's merit but it should be done at key points, not detailing the details
* Try to work in your head as much as possible
* Also sometimes the latex formatting gets in the way of clearly organizing. 
  * Do keep the clear notes and later reorganize

## Stop being results driven 
* just because you make alot of progress or win, it is not a indicator of how well you are doing
* because there are too many variables that determine whether you are doing well or not

## Sometimes you want to play
* I can tell you (math) is one of the purest form of play there is really
* Theme like space, underwater?
* Anyone can do this, really. Just be dedicated and focused and persistent
* Devoted

## If your head hurts, go back and review
* Update the notes and clean it up while reviewing
* To make the review a pleasant process, take good notes

## Look carefully at each statement, example, problem
* And consider the possibilities and variations in it's statement
* For example $(0,1/n) and (0,\inf)$


## Need continued inspiration
* Faith
* Motivation

## When introduced with new object $X$
* $X R X$
* $X + X$
  * Special objects in the operation?
* $X R X \rightarrow X Q X$
* function?

## Exercises
* Before I looked at exercises as just something I needed to prove and be done with
* Now I see them as perspectives, points of view
* And after one is resolved, I think, what is the implication, consequences of this?
  * How does this shift the way I can think about the objects

## Ok, so I learned some considerable amount of information
* How can I make them so they become second nature?
* I feel like I am working through to 'prove' them again from scratch
* Need to summarize what I learned in a common/natural sense way


## Relax. Dont be anxious, its no way to live life.
* Enjoy the process
* Inspect each step
* Take your time and make sure it is spent meaningfully

## Hints are dangerous
* need a proper reason to arrive at the solution
* I had assumed $x_1 < x_2 < x_3 ...$ when it was $\{ x_1, x_2, x_3 \}$, leading me towards a wrong solution
* Consider the most basic facts and lay them out
* Assumptions are fine as long as you know they are assumptions and are willing to forgo

## Dont aim to learn everything, learn to think and work through, the process

## Exercise
* To come up with potential good question that investigate connections.
  * And the solve these questions
* To come up with good examples
* What kind of thing can help with building something like this?
  * Like a list of definitions and their input and output and descriptions/interactions/behavior and theorems

## Lets break down definition supremum
* $sup S$ is a upper bound of $S$
* if u is upper bound of $S$, then $sup S \leq u$
* What are the inputs that define supremum? (S set)
* What are the output of the definition? (real value)
* Can anything other than input output influence or server some connection?


## In terms of time, right now things are easy
* But later on its more difficult you should still set some timeline to make sure you don't slip
* And also you need practice for when it is difficult 
* It doesn't have to be perfect but some sembalance of mastery is ok

## There is a distinct difference VS
* working out a problem loosely in your mind or on scratch
* And writing out the formal statement
* Make sure you are good on both and not get to focused on one aspect

## When you dont feel motivated... what should you do?
* Why you feel this way.
* How can you change the way you feel?
* I want to have fun
* Just stay bored, day dream

## Your routine, will define you who become
* Do you remember when you used to exercise in the beginning? At DePauw or at Mizzou?
* You spent a similar amount of time at the gym
  * How are you different then and now?, its the routine, exercise I spend doing.

## What kinds of routine or exercise can you do?
* Manipulating ideas in your mind
* Metric: Time, Steps, No of Ideas, No of Connections, Memory/Mindfulness, Familiarity/Recall
  * Time per task, assess how many effort it took
  * Go through each new idea and see if you can slowly see the potential connection
  * Move through the ideas in your head
  * How can you effectively learn new ideas and become familar with them?

## When you learn a new definition:
* Deconstruct it. play with it
* Try to form connections to other existing nodes of knowledge
* I think this will help to solidify the definition into your memory and mind


## How to objectively track your mental skill?
* What indicators can you track?
  * Time
  * No of ideas, steps
    * No of interconnected ideas
  * Familiarity (New vs Old)
  * Parallel comparison between lifting, weight, rep, sets, form, 
  * A realization i had with lifting is that the combinations of lifts that you build up, the routine is eventually what will make your physique
* How can you improve these areas? Practice and continued challenge

## There is a meaningful meaning why something is the case. carefully search for it

## You have to be comfortable in your own skin to be able to think freely
* To be able to relax and not be anxious
* Breathe

## Goal is how can I become a better navigator of ideas
* Why is it important to have collaries and branch out?
  * To have more interesting perspectives and starting points
* When should you return to an idea?
* Practice the technique of finding solution. It is easy to forget ideas but if you have technique you can rediscover from a starting point
  * That's why it's like climbing a mountain, learning to navigate
  * Not memorizing or ticking off a list

## The more i do this, I realize that it is important skill to be familiar with concepts and ideas that you have learned and picked up and to internalize them
* So how can you be better at it?

## I think it is important to note how you are doing and feeling while you are progressing in the activity of studying
* So you can adjust patterns and optmize yourself for growth

## I notice that after a prolonged time by brain has difficulty slowly going through and holding ideas my head
* And I just want to rush things
* What can I do in this case?
  * Rest relax

## Breathe, blood flow, the brain is organ which has physical requirements

## When a new value with equality is introduced, what set of operations can be used to form it. is it unique?

## Slow down
* Sometimes you need to warm up 

## FOCUS
* What gives you this focus
* being able to forgo the other issues worries and fears
* Safety in trust of God
* Purpose and a goal. Tunnel Visioning
* Some times its not good to too narrowly tunnel

## Fun
* Why is it that when I play I feel like I am having so much fun?
  * And that I am drawn to it over and over again?
  * Some idea of fantasy that you are
  * Social recognition?
  * No consequence?
* Not Fun
  * Why do you get upset and irritable?
  * Its not really a comfortable position

## When something is inconvinient can you find a better or more compact representation?
* Bijections are difficult to construct every time to show countability, so develop implications or conditions that can extend the countability

## Creating the mood
* Do you ever notice, when you clean out place before leaving, you work in a state of frenzy trance calm
* Or when preparing before an exam, without the pressure or the stress you study the best
* You seem to study well when there is well defined, physical, pressure

## From a new idea, how many more ideas can be formed in combination with existing ideas? 
* Set of existing ideas = [ identity, inverse, transitive, union, intersection, equality, less than or equal, subset ]
* What does each concept interact with?
* Equivalence
* To facilitate this naturally, when you see each symbol and component, be mindful of it's full definition and what each component interacts with

## In order to start thinking about something, you need context. What kinds of context do you need?
* Also, when writing and recording ideas how can you limit and minize the context?
* context/overhead

## Thinking is also like lifting. Before you start, you need proper bracing and have the relevant ideas in place
* Without this, it is wasted or poorly invested effort. whatever is worth doing is worth doing poorly 
* (but it is also worth trying to do with the proper form whatever that is)

## Sometimes when I study, i get tired. How can i rest and recover? from a mental fatigue
* Is it similar to resting for a workout?

## What does this mean? What good properties arise from this
## Go through the material slowly do not rush it
* Or finish it as an attempt to check off a list of things or list of facts to learn
* You need to have the basics down

## What kinds of things should I look into and are scalable?
  * Whichever you learn, make sure to organize the material well so that it can be abstracted and extended
  * ask lots of questions

## Mantra
* You are a musician with the barbell or the material
* Even though it is hard, I will do it
* FOCUS
* Relax and throw punches, rest and try again
* Studying is like training

## What is the end goal?
* Need some reward 
* To be able to learn, explore, organize, and communicate them in an effective way
* Speed
* Strength
* Art, Beauty

## Mapping out the space
* How about the converse?
* How does this relate to what we already know?


# Guiding Questions

* How will the notes I have written help?
  * How are they valuable?
    * It would be really nice if they were typed up!!!!
    * Scratch -> Outline -> Type
  * The importance of going back and reviewing what you have learned

* What happened? How did I get so burnt out? Why am i starting again?
  * How is this scenario similar to working out?
  * You gotta be chill and focused

* solving problems, pushing prs, while great, isn't the status quo
  * dont you wish you were back at it solving problems thinking about theorems and implications?
  * What does it mean to be fresh and the map out the area again?

* You cannot just passively chase some goal
  * You must be focused and have a direction
  * You must rest
  * You must want it
  * It wont happen unless you will it
  * Try your best and relax

* Cozy up to get ready for a good book or movie or a good study? good ideas?

* Psalms 103:15-18 New International Version (NIV)
  * As for man, his days are as grass; As a flower of the field, so he flourisheth. For the wind passeth over it, and it is gone; And the place thereof shall know it no more. But the lovingkindness of Jehovah is from everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear him, And his righteousness unto children’s children; To such as keep his covenant, And to those that remember his precepts to do them.

* When I was learning in school, it was quite fun.
  * Because of community and motivation
  * Because of exam that is pressuring
  * How can we recreate a similar experience?

* What gives you interest?
  * I wanna be cool
* What happended in your past when you were self-exploring and didn't find much progress?
  * Lack of a concrete goal, image of who I was going to be
* When in your life did you find alot of progress?
  * Focus
  * Dedication
* Who do you want to be for real?
  * A friend of God, Fitness, Mathematics
* What is the reason why you chose these two?
  * Can do almost anywhere, independent

* Most importantly, how to have fun
  * Schedule the time and work on it as an activity
  * Work on train of thought and focus
  * How to progress

* When trying to decide whether something is true or false, work through the possibilities and see if each step contradics the given facts
  * for example consider the normal sets $ A /delta B /delta G$ is A normal in G?
  * Well does $gAg^-1$ return to A? $gBg^-1$ returns to B and $bAb^-1$ returns to A. If g in $gAg^-1$ is not in B, there is nothing which stops it from being in $B/A$

* What is interest? It is when I can keep thinking about the idea in my head
* Make sure you are intrested in the problem. interest, intrinsic
    * Interest: of importance, to be between (inter) between
    * Intrinsic: (intra) within

* How can I explore effectively.
  * What must be true?
  * Dont assume that this will lead to an answer but do explore
  * Think simple. Work simple
  * It is very hard sometimes haha, understand your limitations

* Extrinsic motivation will reduce the intrinsic motivation of the activity

* Why did I burn out and how can I prevent?
  * Seek to understand, not to finish
  * Seek to explore, not to claim
  * Seek for learning and be humble, do not be prideful
  * Take your time, do not rush
  * Be consistent

* Progression? What would you like to become?
* Breathe
* Enjoy the present/process journey, not the destination

* Dont feel pride in what you accomplish because that will ruin the fun in the long run
  * Be content and happy for just exploring. Imagine you are surfing and you take pride in 'oh I surfed that big wave, or oh I'm so better than others', you'll not enjoy the moment...
  * Men must be taught as if you taught them not And things unknown proposed as things forgot
  * You cannot teach a man anything; you can only help him to find it within himself
  * Be wiser than other people if you can; but do not tell them so.
  * One thing only I know, and that is that I know nothing. 
  * There’s magic, positive magic, in such phrases as: "I may be wrong. I frequently am. Let’s examine the facts.



* When you are thinking and meditating
  * Try working with the objects in your mind, if you have to write write as least as you can
  * it must become so simple, so that you can fluidly work with the concepts in your mind, 
  * Because being hunched over desk is no fun, i must develop my memory

* Find a perspective that makes you want to do things instead of having to do them
* What inspires you to learn, understand?
* Do we really need to spend time learning this?
* What are we studying here? Knowledge acquisition and internalization
* What are the key themes?
* What are you curious about? 
* Why is it interesting/significant?
* What is narrative, progression?

* What is a good way to make sure I can understand the old material/theorma I learned quickly?
  * This is a good question, i think there is no other way but to dig deep.

* What is the desired end goal?
  * Be able to work with ideas and at least keep up with the pace of regular semester in the depth I would like
  * Be careful of sinkholes



# Guiding Methods

* TEST yourself
	* ~ Self explaining lecture
	* ~ Studying for a test

* Have a GOAL in mind:

* A new chapter with many new ideas will take time to explore and understand

* Make a list of objectives and goals

* Learn the tools that get you there. Dont memorize. (Paul Erdos forgetting Hasdorf next day)
* Enjoy the process not the destination.
* Make it complete by making it simple enough to explain to a person on the street
* It is your grand adventure

* Key themes
* Keep it simple. Key points to remember.
* Constantly cut and refine. Evolve adapt. Organic.
	* Small details you can revisit as you work with it. 
	* Less is more




# Notes
* Style, Sufficient words to point
* Format, Paper -> Digital

* (N)ote: Narrative. Progression (defined start,end). Teaching someone. Key Questions. Key ideas. Key problems.
* (L)og: Journal. Record. Scratch work. Study Meta. Thought Process. Direction.
	* N,L are related by subject.
	* Indexing to relate subject in N,L
	* N is independent of time.
	* L is focused more around time. 

# Process
* Dont memorize

* Write Draft (N)otes
	* Scratch Paper -> Write Journal Log
* Rewrite Notes Blind
	* Scratch Paper -> Write Journal Log
* (Research) Questions, (Research) Problems

# Motivation
* Internal vs External Motivation
* Inspiration
  * Find reasons why it is interesting
  * I want to see the connections and how it works and understand it :)
* Showmanship and Craftsmanship
  * To take pride in one's work
* If you want something, you must go after it with all your might and capacity.
* You musted be obessed. Focused
* Problems are like training drills. To review your mastery of the material.
* You must have good and clear goals in mind.
    * Otherwise you will lose track of yourself
* Start small 
* Some progress is better than none
* If something is worth doing, it is worth doing badly

# STUCK
* So we were stuck on permutation
  * Do we have to learn it?
  * Can we skip it?
  * Always question the issues you are dealing with from every angle.
    * Write about it, talk about it, think about it, feel about it in the hopes the answer will come to you
