# Anchor points:
* Use anchors to secure/manage your train of thoughts while thinking/reading a book

# Free notes

## As you are going through,

* Consider, what is the barebones that I need to understand the picture that is being laid in front of me.
* How do I not miss the forest for the trees?
* Be relaxed, you will revisit the topics again.

## Exercise / Progress
* Before, I measure my progress/ability based on completition or complete understanding of exercise/theorem
  * I think I needed to come to internal terms with this value
* It is very important that your reward and motivation comes from the process of itself, not the destination
* For process leads to destination and sometimes process maybe long as you travel longer
* Enjoy the exercise, see what questions arise, see where you are going with the problem
* Look where you are interested, see the significance of what you do, don't just blindly do it. Be in tune

## My future route, amateur mathematics
https://mathoverflow.net/questions/422196/is-amateur-research-in-mathematics-viable

## Do you know how you rest prior to lifting
* And prepare every ounce of your strength

## From mess to clarity
* Mess and mucking around and headaches.. for 4 days
* Emergence of clarity after finding the right 'mindset' of artist painting
* Big factor of this was me not group concepts together into functions and instead just applying things randomly in a process
* **Group concepts together, isolate input and outputs**
* Also a key idea is that you weren't sure how to create the end effect to begin with
  * Which means, you needed to experiment more
    * **But you need to structure your experimentation**
      * With varied pathways and common processes that will help you cut down on time
* Math, especially my MAPranaly is similar to program for the mind. 
  * It is a way of grouping concepts together to describe something or see what can come out
  * It is a story, an art

* Today I dont have a headache
  * I think a big part is attributed to actually solving the problem
  * And organizing your ideas so you actually know what you did to solve the problem

## Re organize
* I think at least once a month, I should spend time to reorganize and regroup


## Health and thinking
* Breathe, get that oxygen to your body
* Take care of yourself, your well-being influences how you can think and perform
* Adapt evolve be hungry and squeeze every last bit of juice out of life
* Why do people say, you need to discover or do something in your prime?
* Maintain/manage the prime

## Brain tired, overworked, Rest
* Overworked
  * I am not sure where this feeling came from...
    * I think I saw some other people ahead of where I was and I felt like I was falling behind so I wanted to put in this effort to 'catch up'
    * And so I didn't really take care of myself, because nothing matter more than (getting it done, putting the flag in, and finishing)
    * But this isn't true in life. Something else will come
  * Make a promise, that you will never feel like you are behind. and work at your own pace

* DO i need rest?
  * headache
  * Lack of alertness, brain slowing down
* I think there is a problem with your approach causing you headaches and tiredness
* While you do need rest if your conditions are not improving, try to see what caused this issue in the first place.
  * You kept ramming at the solution without a constructive approach and really thinking about what it was you were doing
  * Need to create a systematic axiom to manage your thought like in math
  * Like, you are adding things together to create a blend, you need to analyze that and figure out if it holds true... etc
* Mindset and attitude
  * Should be towards making something which makes sense and whole
  * Not towards just making something happen just for the sake of it
    * This is why you were feeling like you were frustrated because you wanted to finish (without understanding)
    * You wanted to 'just do it' without really understanding or creating a good system
* Some of the ideas you came up with were good but they were some general directions, you need to sit down and thik about the core of the problem
  * I kept putting it off


## Implementation
* Implement in the simplest way before trying to optimize
* Simplicity of code is better than faster optimization with more complexity

## **As soon as your head hurts/feels uncomfortable stop**
* And try to find a more efficient better way to approach the problem
* it is extremely draining and not good for your energy reserves

## Health and Focus
* Need to exercise to keep the blood flowing and keep yourself alert and agile
* This is something you should not sacrifice

## Head hurting?
* eye pain?
* What you likely are experiencing is stress and strain resulting from negative thoughts and emotions regarding the difficulty and/or inconvenience of studying whatever it is you are trying to learn
* Relax and stop beating yourself up for not knowing or learning the material as fast as you think you should.
* Accept the fact that you must spend time doing the studying and thank yourself for doing the work.
* Treat yourself with the same respect, tolerance and acceptance that you would show another person.
* I suspect that when you concentrate like that you are unconsciously tensing the muscles in your head and neck leading to a tension headache. These are felt inside your head, thus the feeling that your brain hurt
### stress, frustration ?
* You dont take interest in your subjects.
* You are setting long targets and at the end u are unable to achieve it, and get frustrated or may be u are not setting your targets.
* May be,you dont have a sound environment for studies and u get distracted.
* You think that u can study for long hours(say 4â€“5) continuously which isnt possible my friend.


## how is math diff from programming
* math is more about exploring, (sometimes there isn't a goal)
  * Looking at the consequences of something, defining
* pgramming has a very specific goal you want to achieve
  * And the art is identifying/breaking down common workflows into a series
  * I think you should practice this more ina more abstract workflow sense
  * Must be aware of performance as well (This is quite big...)
    * often times I cannot think in the most simple way because of performance considerations
    * Then what happens is that I end up 
    * **building a tool that abstracts the thing in a simple away but is implemented in a efficient way **

## Tasks to refresh your mind
* Try different mediums, techniques
  * Paper, listening, oratory, typing, presenting
  * Limit cognitive overload


## Always seek opportunity to reduce, simplify
* It helps to clarify the mind

## Who are you?
* I am a warrior it is a part of me to be strong, brave, courageous
* I am also weak, afraid
* It is a core part of my identity

## My lack of ability to remember or organize as strongly as others
* blind-wandering fool, maybe my lack of strong-memory, tendency to forget is an advantage
* being able to approach things anew
* Things of most signifiance strike out at me
## questions/problems and workflow examples
* Help to expand and explore the consequences of your definitions
* Directing your thought towards something specific
* guide and help to verify your set of rules
* Even if the set of rules change, the problems are stable. 
  * And you can try to prove if the property/question remain under the new rules
* Realized this while setting up different rules/definitions for server

## Unhinge yourself from the limitations set by yourself
* Be realistic, but dont be held back by limitations

## I often cannot find myself or find it difficult to stop thinking about the 
* game emchanics and state and what not, specific examples, different cases, running throught the scenario in my mind
* How can similar thing be achieved for mathematics?
* Play. It is just play. What is fun about math? What is interesting about math.
* You have treated as a means to a goal, like prestiege or tool for AI, understanding etc...
* But what is fun about math? How can you play math? It is like a game with rules

## Big part on working and perservering
* If you believe you can do it, you probably can do it, even when it is difficult
  * Looking at examples really helped me come to a good point with the collision system, ilooked at ap3, push ralph, and simple pusher example
  * If you get frustrated, need to manage it better
* Frustration is difficult to overcome, its a skill
* Manage your ambition and expectations by setting clear goals and checkpoints and review them
* Make sure you rest, and get plenty of sleep
  * Be comfortable when you are working ( This chair is extremely uncomfortable )
* When developing and trying to make a good system, ask questions not write tasks todo
* When refactoring, take those questions into consideration and answer all of thsoe questions in a unified system
* What are the questions we had when we were developing this engine?
* Whatever your goal is, work hard towards it, with your heart and body and soul and also keep these poitns/questions in mind


## Fight or Flight response and heart beating under stress and pressure
* Focus your mentality and mind and soul
* Maybe its the voice in your head saying you MUST solve it

## Interesting theorems? Great and beautiful?
* https://mathoverflow.net/questions/412437/breakthroughs-in-mathematics-in-2021

## Reading it voraciously
* More efficient way to get at the core of your goal
* This previous approach is too time consuming

## When you are frustrated
* You often don't see the obvious solution
* You are training to see the correction solution, so be patient 
* map out and work through all the possibilities
* Mathematics is also clerical work (when you get stuck and are branching out)

## On improving and getting better
* As long as you can see how you are improving or see some direction in which you can improve, it is good
* Sometimes you may not see it at all.

## RP Sim
*  achieved my childhood lifelong dream, in a span of 2 weeks
  * Some lessons to take away is, think plan and then just try. if you are not sure, just try and see how else you need to improve
  * Another big lesson that was affecting me is ont to get externally motivated.
    * I was getting legit jitters from my dopamine system
* Utilizing a todo list
* A big thing that I need to work on is how to safely distance myself and not burn out
  * I could have arrived at the goal later, tomm, but I choose to keep working late into the night. This isnt really healthy
    * need clear boundaries ( Where do we form the boundaries?)
  * And focus on other objectives
  * I found myself tunneling too deep in this genre and unable to work on other things, workout, relax, sleep, math
  * Good work takes time but try to break it up into chunks to manage better (organization)
* I found that when I encountered a difficult problem it was more productive to laydown and think about it and then try again
* And to conclude, I sincerely congratulate you on your efforts

## How to be patient
* Be committed to seeing the situation through
* Or you will go insane

## So what helps you to work out
* Just do it
* Raw, Emotional
* Why is it different

## Problem solving in a RL
* RL problem solve
  * Infinite action space (Reduce it)
  * Reframing statement that is too hard (to an intermediate step)
* Your notes should be in a format that 
  * reduces action space
  * breaks up big statements into smaller steps
  * clearly reflect this

## Good will
* Be generous have good will when dealing with people
* good will - friendly, helpful, cooperation feelings or attitude
* Be tactful and mericiless when dealing with objects

## Stress
* Stress is like a heavy glass of water
* The longer you hold onto it the more heavy it is 
* Control not being affected by stress, or other things. This is a skill

## Intrinsic Motivation
* Make sure you are careful to not attach too much to the extrinsic motivation
* The Process is more than the Result

## Notation 
* Use wording or symbolic notation?
* I think wording has much more flexibilty, the symbols are words themselves

## How do I make myself
* feel in good condition?
* ambitious and energetic?
* what drains my energy?
* self-care
* exercise? routine

## Stress and mental fatigue
* There is no such thing as mental tireness
* It is stress that causes this
* Remove yourself from the forms of stress
* Its bad, non-optimal for thinking

## New style of notetaking 2
* Kind of feels redundant, I want to separate it out better
* I dont think I should repeat, maybe keep the oringal notes for 
  * Examples
  * Proof
  * Extended Discussion
* And keep the second one as just MAP and links of ideas
* As you work from MAP, you may need to prune some stuff over

## A new style of note taking
* In general, keep the things as simple as possible 
* Adding a high level view of just definitions and connections

## Stress
* Breathe
* Mental fatigue is caused by stress
* Stay low, steely and calm
* Don't be committed or invested or emotional
* How can you? Faith in God
* Thanks and trust
* Just try and practice
* Nerves of Steel
  * Ability to remain calm under pressure or difficult situations

## Dont muck your way through thought. It is form

## Math study
* Should think of different ways the objects can interact
* While studying ask questions on try to branch out in simple areas. what should come next?

## You really need to push yourself to grow
* with thinking
* Who do you wish to become?
  * How can you grow sharper, simpler, persistent, 
  * You need to train and rest
* programming

## Exploratory Creative Drive
* Valheim:
* Progression. I had a clear idea of what I wanted to become
* Knew Vaguely what I needed and it was right ahead of me
* Motivated me really well
* Kepth going and going and absoring all sorts of information
* Was really simple: I had some idea of what I needed to do

## Competitive Drive
* Can only compete well for short about of time
* Simple and Optimize

## To be able to think clearly
* You must be mindful of the basic elements involved
* This is very important

## Why do I feel rushed. And feel like I am just skipping over details...
* I feel like the previous days, I have not been working as hard as I should have
* And to compensate I am trying to work extra hard
* But you know, as with lifting, such a thing is not possible to achieve without sacrificing quality
* Keep the quality
  * And be consistent
  * Use the feeling to make sure you are more consistent in the future
* Can't peak, need to be more consistent with your efforts in the long run
  * As with lifting, heavy sets followed by volume, perfect the form


## At a point when you feel like you are slowing down.
* If you need to move ahead, feel free to do so
* Like working through an exam 
* what is the catch, that the stuff ahead doesn't depend on the previous material
* I have mastered all of the material
  * Think, work, and sweat through every combination of ideas
  * Of course it is not easy!

## Need to make sure I am thinking through the thing I read
* I can do this by closing the book and recalling it in my memory

## Why did I get stuck in this area for some time?
* I think it was fine, the progression of ideas to prove this
* Just needed to not get lost in the details and keep track of the big steps
* I did feel overwhelmed and tired after making too many jumps without properly writing down the different steps

## Sometimes when I write too much, i get lost in the details.
* And focus too much on the writing aspect rather than thinking
* I believe writing has it's merit but it should be done at key points, not detailing the details
* Try to work in your head as much as possible
* Also sometimes the latex formatting gets in the way of clearly organizing. 
  * Do keep the clear notes and later reorganize

## Stop being results driven 
* just because you make alot of progress or win, it is not a indicator of how well you are doing
* because there are too many variables that determine whether you are doing well or not

## Sometimes you want to play
* I can tell you (math) is one of the purest form of play there is really
* Theme like space, underwater?
* Anyone can do this, really. Just be dedicated and focused and persistent
* Devoted

## If your head hurts, go back and review
* Update the notes and clean it up while reviewing
* To make the review a pleasant process, take good notes

## Look carefully at each statement, example, problem
* And consider the possibilities and variations in it's statement
* For example $(0,1/n) and (0,\inf)$


## Need continued inspiration
* Faith
* Motivation

## When introduced with new object $X$
* $X R X$
* $X + X$
  * Special objects in the operation?
* $X R X \rightarrow X Q X$
* function?

## Exercises
* Before I looked at exercises as just something I needed to prove and be done with
* Now I see them as perspectives, points of view
* And after one is resolved, I think, what is the implication, consequences of this?
  * How does this shift the way I can think about the objects

## Ok, so I learned some considerable amount of information
* How can I make them so they become second nature?
* I feel like I am working through to 'prove' them again from scratch
* Need to summarize what I learned in a common/natural sense way


## Relax. Dont be anxious, its no way to live life.
* Enjoy the process
* Inspect each step
* Take your time and make sure it is spent meaningfully

## Hints are dangerous
* need a proper reason to arrive at the solution
* I had assumed $x_1 < x_2 < x_3 ...$ when it was $\{ x_1, x_2, x_3 \}$, leading me towards a wrong solution
* Consider the most basic facts and lay them out
* Assumptions are fine as long as you know they are assumptions and are willing to forgo

## Dont aim to learn everything, learn to think and work through, the process

## Exercise
* To come up with potential good question that investigate connections.
  * And the solve these questions
* To come up with good examples
* What kind of thing can help with building something like this?
  * Like a list of definitions and their input and output and descriptions/interactions/behavior and theorems

## Lets break down definition supremum
* $sup S$ is a upper bound of $S$
* if u is upper bound of $S$, then $sup S \leq u$
* What are the inputs that define supremum? (S set)
* What are the output of the definition? (real value)
* Can anything other than input output influence or server some connection?


## In terms of time, right now things are easy
* But later on its more difficult you should still set some timeline to make sure you don't slip
* And also you need practice for when it is difficult 
* It doesn't have to be perfect but some sembalance of mastery is ok

## There is a distinct difference VS
* working out a problem loosely in your mind or on scratch
* And writing out the formal statement
* Make sure you are good on both and not get to focused on one aspect

## When you dont feel motivated... what should you do?
* Why you feel this way.
* How can you change the way you feel?
* I want to have fun
* Just stay bored, day dream

## Your routine, will define you who become
* Do you remember when you used to exercise in the beginning? At DePauw or at Mizzou?
* You spent a similar amount of time at the gym
  * How are you different then and now?, its the routine, exercise I spend doing.

## What kinds of routine or exercise can you do?
* Manipulating ideas in your mind
* Metric: Time, Steps, No of Ideas, No of Connections, Memory/Mindfulness, Familiarity/Recall
  * Time per task, assess how many effort it took
  * Go through each new idea and see if you can slowly see the potential connection
  * Move through the ideas in your head
  * How can you effectively learn new ideas and become familar with them?

## When you learn a new definition:
* Deconstruct it. play with it
* Try to form connections to other existing nodes of knowledge
* I think this will help to solidify the definition into your memory and mind


## How to objectively track your mental skill?
* What indicators can you track?
  * Time
  * No of ideas, steps
    * No of interconnected ideas
  * Familiarity (New vs Old)
  * Parallel comparison between lifting, weight, rep, sets, form, 
  * A realization i had with lifting is that the combinations of lifts that you build up, the routine is eventually what will make your physique
* How can you improve these areas? Practice and continued challenge

## There is a meaningful meaning why something is the case. carefully search for it

## You have to be comfortable in your own skin to be able to think freely
* To be able to relax and not be anxious
* Breathe

## Goal is how can I become a better navigator of ideas
* Why is it important to have collaries and branch out?
  * To have more interesting perspectives and starting points
* When should you return to an idea?
* Practice the technique of finding solution. It is easy to forget ideas but if you have technique you can rediscover from a starting point
  * That's why it's like climbing a mountain, learning to navigate
  * Not memorizing or ticking off a list

## The more i do this, I realize that it is important skill to be familiar with concepts and ideas that you have learned and picked up and to internalize them
* So how can you be better at it?

## I think it is important to note how you are doing and feeling while you are progressing in the activity of studying
* So you can adjust patterns and optmize yourself for growth

## I notice that after a prolonged time by brain has difficulty slowly going through and holding ideas my head
* And I just want to rush things
* What can I do in this case?
  * Rest relax

## Breathe, blood flow, the brain is organ which has physical requirements

## When a new value with equality is introduced, what set of operations can be used to form it. is it unique?

## Slow down
* Sometimes you need to warm up 

## FOCUS
* What gives you this focus
* being able to forgo the other issues worries and fears
* Safety in trust of God
* Purpose and a goal. Tunnel Visioning
* Some times its not good to too narrowly tunnel

## Fun
* Why is it that when I play I feel like I am having so much fun?
  * And that I am drawn to it over and over again?
  * Some idea of fantasy that you are
  * Social recognition?
  * No consequence?
* Not Fun
  * Why do you get upset and irritable?
  * Its not really a comfortable position

## When something is inconvinient can you find a better or more compact representation?
* Bijections are difficult to construct every time to show countability, so develop implications or conditions that can extend the countability

## Creating the mood
* Do you ever notice, when you clean out place before leaving, you work in a state of frenzy trance calm
* Or when preparing before an exam, without the pressure or the stress you study the best
* You seem to study well when there is well defined, physical, pressure

## From a new idea, how many more ideas can be formed in combination with existing ideas? 
* Set of existing ideas = [ identity, inverse, transitive, union, intersection, equality, less than or equal, subset ]
* What does each concept interact with?
* Equivalence
* To facilitate this naturally, when you see each symbol and component, be mindful of it's full definition and what each component interacts with

## In order to start thinking about something, you need context. What kinds of context do you need?
* Also, when writing and recording ideas how can you limit and minize the context?
* context/overhead

## Thinking is also like lifting. Before you start, you need proper bracing and have the relevant ideas in place
* Without this, it is wasted or poorly invested effort. whatever is worth doing is worth doing poorly 
* (but it is also worth trying to do with the proper form whatever that is)

## Sometimes when I study, i get tired. How can i rest and recover? from a mental fatigue
* Is it similar to resting for a workout?

## What does this mean? What good properties arise from this
## Go through the material slowly do not rush it
* Or finish it as an attempt to check off a list of things or list of facts to learn
* You need to have the basics down

## What kinds of things should I look into and are scalable?
  * Whichever you learn, make sure to organize the material well so that it can be abstracted and extended
  * ask lots of questions

## Mantra
* You are a musician with the barbell or the material
* Even though it is hard, I will do it
* FOCUS
* Relax and throw punches, rest and try again
* Studying is like training

## What is the end goal?
* Need some reward 
* To be able to learn, explore, organize, and communicate them in an effective way
* Speed
* Strength
* Art, Beauty

## Mapping out the space
* How about the converse?
* How does this relate to what we already know?


# Guiding Questions

* How will the notes I have written help?
  * How are they valuable?
    * It would be really nice if they were typed up!!!!
    * Scratch -> Outline -> Type
  * The importance of going back and reviewing what you have learned

* What happened? How did I get so burnt out? Why am i starting again?
  * How is this scenario similar to working out?
  * You gotta be chill and focused

* solving problems, pushing prs, while great, isn't the status quo
  * dont you wish you were back at it solving problems thinking about theorems and implications?
  * What does it mean to be fresh and the map out the area again?

* You cannot just passively chase some goal
  * You must be focused and have a direction
  * You must rest
  * You must want it
  * It wont happen unless you will it
  * Try your best and relax

* Cozy up to get ready for a good book or movie or a good study? good ideas?

* Psalms 103:15-18 New International Version (NIV)
  * As for man, his days are as grass; As a flower of the field, so he flourisheth. For the wind passeth over it, and it is gone; And the place thereof shall know it no more. But the lovingkindness of Jehovah is from everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear him, And his righteousness unto childrenâ€™s children; To such as keep his covenant, And to those that remember his precepts to do them.

* When I was learning in school, it was quite fun.
  * Because of community and motivation
  * Because of exam that is pressuring
  * How can we recreate a similar experience?

* What gives you interest?
  * I wanna be cool
* What happended in your past when you were self-exploring and didn't find much progress?
  * Lack of a concrete goal, image of who I was going to be
* When in your life did you find alot of progress?
  * Focus
  * Dedication
* Who do you want to be for real?
  * A friend of God, Fitness, Mathematics
* What is the reason why you chose these two?
  * Can do almost anywhere, independent

* Most importantly, how to have fun
  * Schedule the time and work on it as an activity
  * Work on train of thought and focus
  * How to progress

* When trying to decide whether something is true or false, work through the possibilities and see if each step contradics the given facts
  * for example consider the normal sets $ A /delta B /delta G$ is A normal in G?
  * Well does $gAg^-1$ return to A? $gBg^-1$ returns to B and $bAb^-1$ returns to A. If g in $gAg^-1$ is not in B, there is nothing which stops it from being in $B/A$

* What is interest? It is when I can keep thinking about the idea in my head
* Make sure you are intrested in the problem. interest, intrinsic
    * Interest: of importance, to be between (inter) between
    * Intrinsic: (intra) within

* How can I explore effectively.
  * What must be true?
  * Dont assume that this will lead to an answer but do explore
  * Think simple. Work simple
  * It is very hard sometimes haha, understand your limitations

* Extrinsic motivation will reduce the intrinsic motivation of the activity

* Why did I burn out and how can I prevent?
  * Seek to understand, not to finish
  * Seek to explore, not to claim
  * Seek for learning and be humble, do not be prideful
  * Take your time, do not rush
  * Be consistent

* Progression? What would you like to become?
* Breathe
* Enjoy the present/process journey, not the destination

* Dont feel pride in what you accomplish because that will ruin the fun in the long run
  * Be content and happy for just exploring. Imagine you are surfing and you take pride in 'oh I surfed that big wave, or oh I'm so better than others', you'll not enjoy the moment...
  * Men must be taught as if you taught them not And things unknown proposed as things forgot
  * You cannot teach a man anything; you can only help him to find it within himself
  * Be wiser than other people if you can; but do not tell them so.
  * One thing only I know, and that is that I know nothing. 
  * Thereâ€™s magic, positive magic, in such phrases as: "I may be wrong. I frequently am. Letâ€™s examine the facts.



* When you are thinking and meditating
  * Try working with the objects in your mind, if you have to write write as least as you can
  * it must become so simple, so that you can fluidly work with the concepts in your mind, 
  * Because being hunched over desk is no fun, i must develop my memory

* Find a perspective that makes you want to do things instead of having to do them
* What inspires you to learn, understand?
* Do we really need to spend time learning this?
* What are we studying here? Knowledge acquisition and internalization
* What are the key themes?
* What are you curious about? 
* Why is it interesting/significant?
* What is narrative, progression?

* What is a good way to make sure I can understand the old material/theorma I learned quickly?
  * This is a good question, i think there is no other way but to dig deep.

* What is the desired end goal?
  * Be able to work with ideas and at least keep up with the pace of regular semester in the depth I would like
  * Be careful of sinkholes



# Guiding Methods

* TEST yourself
	* ~ Self explaining lecture
	* ~ Studying for a test

* Have a GOAL in mind:

* A new chapter with many new ideas will take time to explore and understand

* Make a list of objectives and goals

* Learn the tools that get you there. Dont memorize. (Paul Erdos forgetting Hasdorf next day)
* Enjoy the process not the destination.
* Make it complete by making it simple enough to explain to a person on the street
* It is your grand adventure

* Key themes
* Keep it simple. Key points to remember.
* Constantly cut and refine. Evolve adapt. Organic.
	* Small details you can revisit as you work with it. 
	* Less is more




# Notes
* Style, Sufficient words to point
* Format, Paper -> Digital

* (N)ote: Narrative. Progression (defined start,end). Teaching someone. Key Questions. Key ideas. Key problems.
* (L)og: Journal. Record. Scratch work. Study Meta. Thought Process. Direction.
	* N,L are related by subject.
	* Indexing to relate subject in N,L
	* N is independent of time.
	* L is focused more around time. 

# Process
* Dont memorize

* Write Draft (N)otes
	* Scratch Paper -> Write Journal Log
* Rewrite Notes Blind
	* Scratch Paper -> Write Journal Log
* (Research) Questions, (Research) Problems

# Motivation
* Internal vs External Motivation
* Inspiration
  * Find reasons why it is interesting
  * I want to see the connections and how it works and understand it :)
* Showmanship and Craftsmanship
  * To take pride in one's work
* If you want something, you must go after it with all your might and capacity.
* You musted be obessed. Focused
* Problems are like training drills. To review your mastery of the material.
* You must have good and clear goals in mind.
    * Otherwise you will lose track of yourself
* Start small 
* Some progress is better than none
* If something is worth doing, it is worth doing badly

# STUCK
* So we were stuck on permutation
  * Do we have to learn it?
  * Can we skip it?
  * Always question the issues you are dealing with from every angle.
    * Write about it, talk about it, think about it, feel about it in the hopes the answer will come to you
