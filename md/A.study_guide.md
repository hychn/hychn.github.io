* solving problems, pushing prs, while great, isn't the status quo
  * dont you wish you were back at it solving problems thinking about theorems and implications?
  * What does it mean to be fresh and the map out the area again?

* Psalms 103:15-18 New International Version (NIV)
  * As for man, his days are as grass; As a flower of the field, so he flourisheth. For the wind passeth over it, and it is gone; And the place thereof shall know it no more. But the lovingkindness of Jehovah is from everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear him, And his righteousness unto children’s children; To such as keep his covenant, And to those that remember his precepts to do them.

* When I was learning in school, it was quite fun.
  * Because of community and motivation
  * Because of exam that is pressuring

  * Schedule the time and work on it as an activity
  * Work on train of thought and focus
  * How to progress

* When trying to decide whether something is true or false, work through the possibilities and see if each step contradics the given facts
  * for example consider the normal sets $ A /delta B /delta G$ is A normal in G?
  * Well does $gAg^-1$ return to A? $gBg^-1$ returns to B and $bAb^-1$ returns to A. If g in $gAg^-1$ is not in B, there is nothing which stops it from being in $B/A$

* What is interest? It is when I can keep thinking about the idea in my head
* Make sure you are intrested in the problem. interest, intrinsic
    * Interest: of importance, to be between (inter) between
    * Intrinsic: (intra) within

* How can I explore effectively.
  * What must be true?
  * Dont assume that this will lead to an answer but do explore
  * Think simple. Work simple
  * It is very hard sometimes haha, understand your limitations

* Extrinsic motivation will reduce the intrinsic motivation of the activity

* Why did I burn out and how can I prevent?
  * Seek to understand, not to finish
  * Seek to explore, not to claim
  * Seek for learning and be humble, do not be prideful
  * Take your time, do not rush
  * Be consistent

* Progression? What would you like to become?
* Breathe
* Enjoy the present/process journey, not the destination

* Dont feel pride in what you accomplish because that will ruin the fun in the long run
  * Be content and happy for just exploring. Imagine you are surfing and you take pride in 'oh I surfed that big wave, or oh I'm so better than others', you'll not enjoy the moment...
  * Men must be taught as if you taught them not And things unknown proposed as things forgot
  * You cannot teach a man anything; you can only help him to find it within himself
  * Be wiser than other people if you can; but do not tell them so.
  * One thing only I know, and that is that I know nothing. 
  * There’s magic, positive magic, in such phrases as: "I may be wrong. I frequently am. Let’s examine the facts.



* When you are thinking and meditating
  * Try working with the objects in your mind, if you have to write write as least as you can
  * it must become so simple, so that you can fluidly work with the concepts in your mind, 
  * Because being hunched over desk is no fun, i must develop my memory

* Find a perspective that makes you want to do things instead of having to do them
* What inspires you to learn, understand?
* Do we really need to spend time learning this?
* What are we studying here? Knowledge acquisition and internalization
* What are the key themes?
* What are you curious about? 
* Why is it interesting/significant?
* What is narrative, progression?

* What is a good way to make sure I can understand the old material/theorma I learned quickly?
  * This is a good question, i think there is no other way but to dig deep.

* What is the desired end goal?
  * Be able to work with ideas and at least keep up with the pace of regular semester in the depth I would like
  * Be careful of sinkholes



# Guiding Methods

* TEST yourself
	* ~ Self explaining lecture
	* ~ Studying for a test

* Have a GOAL in mind:

* A new chapter with many new ideas will take time to explore and understand

* Make a list of objectives and goals

* Learn the tools that get you there. Dont memorize. (Paul Erdos forgetting Hasdorf next day)
* Enjoy the process not the destination.
* Make it complete by making it simple enough to explain to a person on the street
* It is your grand adventure

* Key themes
* Keep it simple. Key points to remember.
* Constantly cut and refine. Evolve adapt. Organic.
	* Small details you can revisit as you work with it. 
	* Less is more




# Notes
* Style, Sufficient words to point
* Format, Paper -> Digital

* (N)ote: Narrative. Progression (defined start,end). Teaching someone. Key Questions. Key ideas. Key problems.
* (L)og: Journal. Record. Scratch work. Study Meta. Thought Process. Direction.
	* N,L are related by subject.
	* Indexing to relate subject in N,L
	* N is independent of time.
	* L is focused more around time. 

# Process
* Dont memorize

* Write Draft (N)otes
	* Scratch Paper -> Write Journal Log
* Rewrite Notes Blind
	* Scratch Paper -> Write Journal Log
* (Research) Questions, (Research) Problems

# Motivation
* Internal vs External Motivation
* Inspiration
  * Find reasons why it is interesting
  * I want to see the connections and how it works and understand it :)
* Showmanship and Craftsmanship
  * To take pride in one's work
* If you want something, you must go after it with all your might and capacity.
* You musted be obessed. Focused
* Problems are like training drills. To review your mastery of the material.
* You must have good and clear goals in mind.
    * Otherwise you will lose track of yourself
* Start small 
* Some progress is better than none
* If something is worth doing, it is worth doing badly

# STUCK
* So we were stuck on permutation
  * Do we have to learn it?
  * Can we skip it?
  * Always question the issues you are dealing with from every angle.
    * Write about it, talk about it, think about it, feel about it in the hopes the answer will come to you
