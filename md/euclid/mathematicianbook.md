 First among these faculties I place concentration, the restriction of mental activity to a single object, a secondary faculty in general but of primary importance to the mathematician. The proverbial absentmindedness of mathematicians is but the sign of concentration. 
 Closely related to the first is the second faculty of persistence, which recognizes nothing as impossible until it has been definitely proved to be so; it has overcome many difficulties and has been the cause of much wasted energy; also generally a secondary faculty.

 Most of the very eminent mathematicians have had what would usually be called wonderful memories for everything, almost without exception visual so that they remember better what they have seen or read than what they have heard.
