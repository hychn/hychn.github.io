## [Requirements](https://catalog.ku.edu/liberal-arts-sciences/math/phd/#requirementstext)

* Required qualifying exam coursework
  * MATH 727 (Probability)
  * MATH 765 (Analysis I)
  * MATH 781 (Numerical Analysis I)
  * MATH 791 (Abstract Algebra I)
  * Passing a qualifying exam exempts a student from the corresponding coursework. This coursework must be completed before the preliminary examination.

* Pass 2 written qualifying examinations: one exam in either algebra or analysis and a second exam in either numerical analysis or probability/statistics. Both qualifying examinations must be completed by the beginning of the student’s fifth semester

* Pass a preliminary examination in an area close to the focus of the eventual doctoral dissertation. The preliminary examination must be completed by the beginning of the student’s eighth semester.

* Pass a set of requirements for a track in either Pure Mathematics or Applied Mathematics, as outlined below.

* Normally the work required to prepare a student for the oral comprehensive examination (and to do research) includes 1 or more semesters of advanced courses, directed readings, and seminars. In the oral comprehensive examination, a student must show proficiency in the chosen area of mathematics. Precise areas of responsibility on this examination are discussed in detail with the advisory committee (the student’s advisor and two other members of the department’s Graduate Faculty).
