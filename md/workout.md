# posture and sitting
* sit in squat position, with quad, hamstring, core muscles supporting weight
  * If you lean back, your stomach/organs will bear the weight

# Muscle Activation
* You need to really focus  keeping tight tension and understanding which muscles are being activated 

## Deadlift
* Focus on role and function of hamstring, to rotate the pevlis/extend the femur around hip joint.
* Tighten it, keep a straight back and lift

## Benchpress
* When you descend, pull/row slowly with your back as well to be able to generate the counter forcefrom the
* Keep a tight chest muscle around shoulder joint and keep shoulder joint locked and stable

# FORM
* Yesterday, 12-29, when you did squat you adjusted the form slightly and your squat blew up with much more stability
* from 60kg to 80kg -> 100
* Also, you were practicing ques and form for a while and I think it took several key realizations until you finally got it
  * Had to do alot of research until you found what clicked and made sense (hip hinge)
  * Femur pointing/opening hips
* Good job! I am proud of you. Lets try deadlift now

# CNS

* Be relaxed strike when you need to 

# Deadlift

* RDL TBH

* [vid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=738YXp9a3iE)
* [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/3dw1oa/cant_physically_reach_deadlift_bar_with_straight/)
* deadlift can't reach bar with straight back

* Keep your legs straight and try to get in position for a stiff legged deadlift. If you can't touch the bar, it's a hamstring/glutes/lower back flexibility issue. Do stretches everyday to fix this.
* Drop into the third world squat position. If you can't touch your quads to your chest, it's a hip mobility issue. In that case, practise third world squats.


* practice RDLs. you need to practice your hip hinge starting from the top and hinging down as low as you can go without rounding. over time you'll be able to get lower and lower. (weighted eccentric stretching is extremely effective)
* if doing your deadlifts from blocks (like throw a plate under the weights, maybe 2") lets you have a flat black, do that until you resolve your issues from the floor. find a height that lets you have a flat back and work to lower it over time. don't be stubborn and keep pulling from the floor (IMO).
* try different stance widths / sumo (see above)
* play around with different flexibility/mobility/whatever-you-wana-call-it stuff. dont spend too much time trying something out unless you see results. for me using a barbell to roll out my hamstrings and adductors (trying to loosen up everything close to the insertion at the pelvis) is where the money is at. everything gets really tight at the insertion point to the pelvis. rolling that out is rough but in under 10 minutes it's night and day what it does to my positioning.
* I can't seem to reach down for the bar while maintaining a flat back at my lumbar.
* that's one way to setup. you don't have to setup that way. plenty of people reach down rounded, then straighten out when they take the slack out of the bar. IMO it's easier to do the second approach if you're on the stiffer side. really focus on taking the slack out of the bar & your body before starting the pull.

# 20200828
* Really focus on the muscle contractions as you do the pulling motion. Back to the basics
# 20200819
* Deadlift
  * Gotta lean back so that the weight is on the hips as 
  * Chest out
* Pullups
  * How about using the pull idea from benchpress and push your chest out as you pull?
  * Use wider grip
* Rear Delts and the rotator muscles I think I need to workout
  * see mantaray delt [manta ray back](https://i.imgur.com/yfTNLK1.jpg)
* Low Lats
  * I feel my low lats activate when my elbow becomes closer to my torso.
  * This is much more possible when my arms are in the underhand grip

# Fundamental idea of muscle mechanics

* Muscle can exert the most amount of force when it has been extended, ready to contract
  * Like a elastic string
* This means that for chest, you must tighten your back to allow chest muscle to extend outwards
* How about back?

* When lifting make sure to ask the question how can my body support this weight
  * Support with muscle by using opposing forces 
    * (Bicep/Triceps) 
    * (Quads/Hamstring,Hip) (Core ab and back)

* You reap what you sow
* Form, Volume, Intensity tk build Size

# Bench
* Press shoulder together
  * Lift up but to put weight on the clamped shoulder like in military press
* Lock and slide body up while keeping shoulder blades pressed down on the bench
* Feel chest not use shoulder

# Military Press
* Support Pillar Leg
* Support Pilar Spine
* Lock shoulder blades together and rest weights
* KEEP hips legs engaged as pushing weight up
* Hands wide so that elbows 90 degrees

# Deadlift
* Support Pillar Leg
* Preparation stage
  * Chest out
  * Back strong arch. Locked Position
  * Lats engaged

* 1 Lift with the lats up the knees
* 2 Lift weight hips and quads after
  * As weight moves up knees bring bar up hamstrings close to the core

## Tips
* Dont lift with back lift with (quad/hip)

# Delts
* Lock shoulder blades
* Side lateral raise

# Squat
* Open up hips while squating by tensing knees outward from hip socket
* Screw feet outward
* Hip drive from the bottom when going up
* Place weight over back to avoid knee pain
* Use hamstring as stabilizer

* bend bar over back/elbows far back
* bar stays over midfoot
* screw in your feet. toes out and heels in
* use hips as stabilizer
* watch the knees
* warm up with no weight to get used to the movement

* Need to lean back
* Get a comfortable stance (Lock shoudler and place weight on there kinda like the other lifts)

* Foot slightly tilted, mostly straight
* Solid knees and shins support
* Squeeze abs
* Push outwards on outer edge of feet
* Chest out
* Hamstring tight, quads tight
* Don't fold knees early engage quads. Suck in knees after
* Open up hips
* Hip movement during squat

# Pullup
* Don't release locked solid movement hinge
* High Lats
  * Begin in front lat spread
  * Stop when are makes 90 degree with forearm and bicep
  * I think this is injured, teres minor
* Mid Lats
  * Medium grip
  * Triceps face back at the end of the motion
* Low Lats
  * Lock shoulder outwards sides
  * Pull elbow back

* Lift with your back
* Negative lifts to get the feel
* Lats are attached to top of upper arm, you need to pull that point backwards
* weight needs to be in front of bar to do this movement right
  * because lats do rows not pulldowns


# Biceps, Triceps
* Need to do additional Research

# INDEX
* Support Pillar Leg (Quad/Hamstrings,Hip): Feet outwards 
* Support Pillar Spine (Abs/Back)
 

# Diet
* Eat chicken, potato, rice, onion, pumpkin, edamabe
* Good food
