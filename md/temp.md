# Logic Operations and Properties
* Properties of individual operations (=,^,V,->)
* reflexive, symmetric, transitivity
* Associative
* Knockout
  * T^A = A
  * F^A = F
  * TVA = T
  * FVA = A
  * ??? There is some 'flipped' nature here
  A B A&B A|B
  T T  T   T
  T F  F   T
  F T  F   T
  F F  F   F

* DEF Subsitution A=B -> A@C=B@C
* A^B -> A,B
* A^!A = F
* AV!A = T


??? What comes first? sub or eq? also the definition of = uses ->
= between values
= between functions
= between variables
what are variables?
a function with variables f(A,B) is a variable (I keep thinking back to the table, its such a concrete way to represent the variable space)


* DEF var=var
  * A=B means
    * If A is true then B is true ^ If B is true then A is true
    * This is identical to <->
    * Another way is A True means B True, A False then B False
  * From the defintion, we can see A=A, A=B->B=A, and A=B,B=C->A=C
