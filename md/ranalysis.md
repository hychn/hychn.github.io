# 1.1 Sets and Functions

Consider $f$ and $A$ and $f(A)$. What is the identity? Can there always be an inverse? 
No, consider $f(x)=x^2$ and $ A = \{ 0 < x < 1 \}$. We see that $f^{-1}(f(A)) = \{ -1 < x < 1 \}$. 
What condition can guarantee that you can always find an inverse?

From a new idea, how many more ideas can be formed in combination with existing ideas?
Set of existing ideas = [ identity, inverse, transitive, union, intersection, equality, less than or equal, subset ]

# 1.3 Finite and Infinite Sets

## THM 1.3.2 Cardinality of a finite set is unique
* Given $A \subset B$ it is not possible to form a bijection from B to A
* The uniqueness forms a partition on the finite numeration

## THM 1.3.3 $\mathbb{N}$ is infinite set
## THM 1.3.4 Cardinality and Set operations
* Cardinality of finite members are preserved under union and inclusive set difference
* Cardinality of infinite finite sets 
* ? inf<x contrapositive to x<fin ?
  * Lets see how to contrapositive flips within the argument

## THM 1.3.5 $T \subset S$
* Conclusion (finite/infinite) drawn about one set from another set based on ordering

## DEF denumerable - bijection to N, countable - finite or denum, uncountable - not countable

## THM 1.3.8 $NxN$ is denumerable
* You have comeup with an interesting function. How to show 

## THM 1.3.9 $T \subset S$

# 2 The Real Numbers
# 2.1.1-2.1.3 Algebraic properties of field R
* Uniqueness of 1,0, inverse
* 0*a = 0
* a*b = 0 means one must be 0
# 2.1.4 $\sqrt{2} is irrational$
# Order of $\mathbb{R}$
* Defined in terms of positive number
* Relation
# 2.1.7 Properties of order on R
* if $a>b$ and $b>c$ then $a>b>c$ Transitive
* if $a>b$ then $a+c>b+c$
* if $a>b$ and $c>0$ then $ca>cb$
* if $a>b$ and $c<0$ then $ca<cb$
# No smallest positive  number can exist
# 2.1.9 Thm
If $0 \geq a \gt e \forall e \gt 0$ then $a=0$
# 2.1.10 Thm
If $ab>0$ then $a>0$ $b>0$ or $a<0$ $b<0$

# Remark: Arithemetic-Geometric mean
* $\sqrt{ab} \leq \dfrac{1}{2}(a+b)$
* $(a_1 a_2 ... a_n)^{1/n} \leq \dfrac{1}{n}(a_1+a_2+..+a_n)$

# Remark: Bernoulli's Inequality
* If $x > -1$ then $(1+x)^n \geq 1+nx$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$
