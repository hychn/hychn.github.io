# RL Questions
* On policy vs Off Policy meaning?
* [actor–critic](http://www.incompleteideas.net/book/ebook/node66.html)
  * "Policy-based methods such as the asynchronous advantage actor–critic (A3C) algorithm combine a deep neural network with the actor–critic framework."
* Temporal difference (TD) learning refers to a class of model-free reinforcement learning methods which learn by bootstrapping from the current estimate of the value function

* [What is bootstrapping](https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/26938/what-exactly-is-bootstrapping-in-reinforcement-learning)
  * Bootstrapping in RL can be read as "using one or more estimated values in the update step for the same kind of estimated value".
