# 1. GROUPS
# 1.6 Symmetric, Alternating, and Dihedral Groups
* DEF Even/Odd permutation is written in even/odd number of transpositions
* THM A permutation can be just 1 of even or odd
* DEF $A_n$ set of all even permutations of $S_n$ where $n>2$
* THM $A_n$ is normal subgroup of $S_n$ of index 2 with order $|S_n|/2$. $A_n$ is the only subgroup of $S_n$ of index 2.
  * normal is clear
  * index 2? is there some way to characterize even vs odd permuation? how about start with small case were we can definitely know n=2
    * we have I and (1,2). Now, lets extend this to n=3. How do we for all permutations of $S_3$ from $S_2$?
    * $|S_2|=2$ $|S_3|=3*2$
    * Alternate notation for $S_2$: [1,2] [2,1]
