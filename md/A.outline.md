## Hungerford Problem 1.5.19
Suppose $H\leq G, N\trianglelefteq G$, then $([G:H],|N|)=1 \rightarrow N<H$ and $([G:N],|H|)=1) \rightarrow H<N $
## Prove that every permutation is a product of distjoin cycles
* given a cycle, orbit creates a equi relation btw the elements of {1...N}
## Cor order of ab is lcm of the order of a and b 
## Cor order of product of cycles is lcm of the orders of the cycles
* Need to extend this to work on disjoint cycles
## Any Sn can be decomposed into transpositions
* $(1234) = (12)(13)(14)$
# 20200615 (Tue)
* Show that every permutation can be classified as odd xor even
## How can you 
* Train your ability to seek out different avenues and attack the problem from these angles?
## After working independently and deriving the next two steps of the book, I've come to realizations
* Thinking on your own and asking questions
## Even permutations is a normal subgroup
* Subgroup is clear $a$
## Subgroup is simple if it has no other trivial subgroup
* Odd is not subgroup because it does not contain identity
## No other subgroup has index 2
* I thought about how to draw contradiction
## Even permutation is the unique subgroup of index 2 in Sn
* I tried many many different approaches 
## Really difficult and stuck on (prev problem)
* Ok it was a excepttional difficult exercise that requires a hint of use of a lemma
## The time is now
* I dont want to be fake. I want to be fing legit
##  Examples of Sn
* How does S2 extend to S3? or SN to SN+1
# 20205020
## Burn out
* I have stopped making progress on the problem. Why?

## HUNGERFORD THM 1.4.8 
$|H:H \cap K| \leq |G:K|$. If $|G:K|$ is finite $|H:H \cap K| = |G:K| \leftrightarrow HK = G$
# 210506
## HUNGERFORD THM.1.4.7
$|HK| = \dfrac{|H||K|}{|H \cap K|}$
## Break
* Prevent burnout
## Warning
* Be mindful how you fill up the pages and what you write. Too much and it will clutter.
## Motivation
* If what you are trying to prove is true, there IS a natural solution/connection/reason to get there!
## Questions
* Do I understand all the members/elements/components of the problem?
