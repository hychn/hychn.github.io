# Shortboard

* He had his feet held up slightly out of the water and one ankle crossed over the other. He was flying
  * Since then I've been trying to keep my feet together and my toes pointed backwards. It has made a huge difference in my surfing! I can paddle out much quicker, and get going on a wave much quicker. Also, it shifts my weight forward so I can really feel exactly where my chest is pressed on the board. I can feel if I'm on the sweet spot or not.
* Another tip to add is you want to be centered on the board. Not too far back and having the nose of your board up in the air and vise versa.
  * I try to keep the nose of the board just barley underwater while paddling and combining this with your discovery works well.
* I'd bet the real point of this trick is that it moves your paddling center of gravity to the right spot. Lots of people get this wrong when starting surfing and when moving to shortboard, usually way too far back.
  * I usually tell people to have their center of gravity centered at the bottom of their tits. Just above the solar plexus.
* An add on to keeping your feet out of the water is keeping your legs as straight as possible in order to keep your weight back. The goal is to be scooted up as close to the front of the board as possible, of you bend your knees your moving your center of gravity forward and therefore have to scoot back. Also, don't flex your calfs. Quickest way to cramp up out ther

* Frog kick when coming out of standby position
* Try to ride along side of wave
* Paddle, bend elbow reach under board
* Paddle slow at start then fast at end.
    * start with elbow high?
* Flutter kick at very end

# popup and catching
* timing is crucial
* keeping your speed on shortboard is diffcult. you must not stop paddle
* You want to controll the speed, not to fast not too slow just right
  * strong strokes, gradulally lighter faster stroke
* at the point where your speed is just right and you have not fall down on the wave, popup
* popup straight perp to the wave
* chest arced at start and adjust to maintain balance to not fall down the wave
    * arc back gives less speed, down gives more


# Paddling
* Dont flail about, faster arms does not equal faster forward movement. Make each stroke count, reach out in front ( not too far as said earlier) grip the water, push back, finish the stroke at your thigh. Relax your arm as you recover over the water. The basic physics of it is that as much as possible you want your hand to stay in the same spot as your shoulder rotates and your board and body move past it. The more your hand slips backwards the less your body and board move forward, if that makes sense. If you watch the best swimmers they look almost as if their arms are in slow motion as compared to how fast they are moving, that's what you want to try and look like when you are paddling. 


*  if I've spent a bit of time in the pool swimming and try to mimic that stroke while surfing it doesn't seem to work quite as well. I think the extra extension at the front/catch of the stroke isn't quite as efficient because you can't roll and extend on a surfboard like you would swimming. It is helpful to get a good "catch" near the nose at the beginning of the stroke, but not to the point where it's awkward. One last tip that isn't blatantly stated in the article is arching the back. I have found that arching the back allows for you to lay a couple inches further forward on the board than you would without arching. What this means is that you can arch your back when you first start paddling for the wave and then flatten out as you're scratching for it. This flattening out shifts your center of gravity on the board forward and really help you get over the edge of a wave you may not have otherwise caught.

* Smooth paddling
* shortboard, you sink more, and create more drag
  * You stop alot quicker
* how to plane a shortboard, needs to be flat?
* slight roll of the body


* Let me explain the power benefit really quickly. There are two descriptions of paddling that I use in reference to the rolling from rail to rail. There is a hip driven stroke, and there is a shoulder driven stroke. Both are useful in different situations and I distinguish the two because of where the roll is being initiated. Iâ€™m sure just based on the names of each of these you can figure out what each one is. The hip driven stroke is initiated at the hips and the shoulder driven is initiated from the shoulders.

* In both scenarios, we use our core and in both, the counter-rotation of the body sets us up for a stronger and more powerful underwater armstroke. It lines us up so that we are using our big powerful paddling muscles in our pectoralis major and latissimus dorsi as opposed to our stabilizing rotator cuff muscles, which we want to avoid using for power, and the rotating motion acts like a spring that is wound up and then released.
