# LIFT
* Progression x Proper form (Once the top set starts feeling easy, progress)

* Guiding mindset
  * Focus on form. Volume-based. The weight will come after.
  * Enjoy the process not the destination
  * Breathe!

* Weighted Pullup
* 2 Plates Bench
* tight core Squat
* bottomed out Deadlift

* Backburn
  * Row
  * OHPress

# GOALS
* What is harder, you need to devote more time to

* Applications
* Study Mathematics Alg, Lin Alg, Intro R Analysis
* Study RL pratical industry, atrai-gym
  * spinningup
  * open AI gym tutorial, simple exercises to get started

* Study RL literature/theory
  * oracle, online, offline, 
  * [Bellman operator, Banach's fixed point, solving MDPs](https://opent03.github.io/sums707w21/slides/SUMS707-Lecture2.pdf)
    * This is good primer easy to understand
* Basic probability
  * concise stats book


* Gamedev
  * Easy to learn, difficult to master
  * instrument-like approach
  * variation
