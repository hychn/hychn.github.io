# Study guide


* When a student is exasperatingly slow, the trouble is almost always the same
  * he has no desire at all to solve the problem,
  * even no desire to understand it properly
    * a lack of concentration, wait clumsily for some idea to come and connot do anythign that would accelerate it's coming
    * rush into calculations or constructions without any plan or general idea
  * so stir up his curiosity, give him some desire to solve the problem
  * allow some time to the student to make his mind, to settle down to his task
* Teaching to solve problems is education of the will
  * Solving problems which are not too easy for him, the student learns to 
    * persevere through unsuccess,
    * to appreciate small advances,
    * to wait for the essential idea
    * to concentrate with all his might when it appears
    * familiarize with the varying emotions of the struggle for the solution

* anchor points are an extremely strong tool, to anchor your thoughts and thought directions
  * They can be questions, key properties, objectives
  * Without anchor points, your mind can wander and you can feel naseous

* Problem solving is a loop process
  * Define problem (impact what do we need to know, what are the key elements of problem? what are the issues?
  * Where should we spend our time? Analysis what are we trying to prove/disprove?
  * So what, what implications does our findings have?
  * potential solution: what should we do?
  * next iteration

* 4 phases of solution
  * understanding of problem
    * incomplete understanding, lack of concentration
  * devise a plan
    * rush into calclation and construction without any plan or general idea
    * wait clumsily for some idea to come and cannot do anythign that would accelerate its coming
  * Carrying out the plan 
    * carelessness, lack of patience checking each steap
  * Check the result
    * failure to check result
* Create questions whose answer will allow you to retrace the development of the ideas
* Ask questions as you go and answer them
* Active Learning Mapping Exercise
  * Identify each component in the definition
    * See what the extremes of this component along various dimensions (length, other characteristic)
    * Can/How other properties component affect/interact with the definition? (It almost certainly will)
  * Ask questions about new description
  * What essential informations is being captured from the definition? Why this definition?

* short list of recurring, important, fundamental ideas
* less is more
* Time, time to grow


# Exercises
* discourse with author
  * where you can gain new insights

# Goal
* be able to reason and solve questions in the field effectively
  * even though they may take some time, ultimately be able to draw conclusions
* it is not: a list of problems and theorems you have originally found or proven

# Mood
* Be happy and thankful
* Give glory to God
* Cautious optimism
* If uncomfortable/head hurts, reorganize and consider better way
* Rest, sleep, health, relaxed-alert
* Be careful of your sources of motivation; internal/external
* Before, I used to feel proud of myself of my little accomplishments to help me feel better and safer
  * But now... I can't. I know how little these things mean 
  * And with more I learn, the more I realize how little I know
  * I will not boast of works
  * I will just be happy for the sake of being happy

# Heuristic
* Anchor points
* Consider the most basic facts and lay them out
* When really stuck, investigate the objects & their properties that are involved
* Consider the opposite, other-direction
* Focus on the big picture
* Mapping
  * what is the mindset that will naturally give these mappings?
    * In what way can, A interact with B? A&B interact with C? ... for all A,B,C in knowledge
  * When learning set of new objects X
    * XRX->B
    * +:XxX -> X
    * special objects in X with respect to *
    * f(X) ~ g(X)
    * = <
    * How does it relate to old definitions/relations?
    * Consider the variations in the defintion?
    * intra and inter relationship of definition

# Notes
* sectioned, modular pairings of (details, outline)
  * details: notes, proofs, insights
  * outline: concise organization of ideas
    * similar to cs program
* Want them to be useful, refreshing myself on the topic, dont want to forget

# Learning by managing stress and repetition
* short-term stress enhances the connections your brain makes, require fewer repetitions
  * coffee, cold water, exercise
* repetition types
  * writing notes
  * explaining from scratch
  * orating, teaching
