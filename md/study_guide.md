# Study guide
* short list of recurring, important, fundamental ideas
* less is more

# Goal
* be able to reason and solve questions in the field effectively

  * When learning set of new objects X
    * XRX->B
    * +:XxX -> X
    * special objects in X with respect to *
    * f(X) ~ g(X)
    * = <
    * How does it relate to old definitions/relations?
    * Consider the variations in the defintion?
    * intra and inter relationship of definition

# Notes
* sectioned, modular pairings of (details, outline)
  * details: notes, proofs, insights
  * outline: concise organization of ideas
    * similar to cs program
* Want them to be useful, refreshing myself on the topic, dont want to forget

# Learning by managing stress and repetition
* short-term stress enhances the connections your brain makes, require fewer repetitions
  * coffee, cold water, exercise
